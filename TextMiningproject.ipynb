When a Snapper is in the ON state and is receiving power from its input plug, then the device connected to its output socket is receiving power as well. When you snap your fingers – making a clicking sound – any Snapper receiving power at the time of the snap toggles between the ON and OFF states. In hopes of destroying the universe by means of a singularity, I have purchased $N$ Snapper devices and chained them together by plugging the first one into a power socket, the second one into the first one, and so on. The light is plugged into the $N$th Snapper. Initially, all the Snappers are in the OFF state, so only the first one is receiving power from the socket, and the light is off. I snap my fingers once, which toggles the first Snapper into the ON state and gives power to the second one. I snap my fingers again, which toggles both Snappers and then promptly cuts power off from the second one, leaving it in the ON state, but with no power. I snap my fingers the third time, which toggles the first Snapper again and gives power to the second one. Now both Snappers are in the ON state, and if my light is plugged into the second Snapper it will be on. I keep doing this for hours. Will the light be on or off after I have snapped my fingers $K$ times? The light is on if and only if it’s receiving power from the Snapper it’s plugged into.'\n",

Such characters include space, and she might have replaced a character with the same character, causing no effect.

      "Here is the problem description: You are the boss of ACM (Association for Control over Minds), an upstanding company with a single goal of world domination. Yesterday, you woke up, and saw that the weather was clear, and the birds were singing. “Another day, another world domination plan”, you sang to yourself as you devised your next world domination plan involving the illusory mind control potions. There’s only one insignificant problem you have to solve before you can execute this perfection of a plan: you don’t know the correct recipe for the mind control potion. You asked the local Panda-breed brewmaster for the recipe, but unfortunately he didn’t know either. Instead, he gave you the mysterious tome titled The Root of all Evil (written by Halim the White). You read the evil book under candle light, and wrote down all the potion recipes contained inside the book. “One of them must be the formula for the mind control potion, I’m sure of it!”, you said to yourself. You numbered these recipes from $1$ through $N$. “I just need to try concocting all of these recipes!”, you hummed to yourself. Today, you woke up, and saw that the weather was clear, and…, anyway. You have purchased all the utensils and ingredients from the local grocery — onion, carrot, broom, vials, cauldrons, bat wings, …, all common grocery items. Now, you are ready to begin your experiments, but then you notice that some of the recipes share common ingredients! Unfortunately, you only bought one of each ingredient with you. “Oh no! What should I do now?!”, you panicked. “I’ll just create some of the potions today, and do the remaining ones later.”, you resolved. You consider all your recipes one by one in order by their number from recipe $1$ through recipe $N$. For each recipe, if you are not able to concoct this potion (explained in the next paragraph), you skip this recipe, and consider the next one, if any. Otherwise, even though it may cause some of the next potions to no longer be concoctable, you concoct this recipe. Thus, whether to concoct a potion is not a choice. It’s simply determined by whether it is possible or not to do so when you consider the potion. In order to concoct a potion, you first prepare a new empty cauldron (you managed to procure an infinite number of cauldrons from the grocery store). Then, you combine all of the ingredients required for this potion and nothing else in this cauldron (that is, the cauldron cannot contain any ingredients not listed in the recipe). For the ingredients that have not been used for any of the previous potions that you’ve decided to concoct, you can simply put it into this cauldron. You can also pour the entire content of the cauldron used for one of your previous concoctions into this cauldron, thus mixing in all of the ingredients contained inside the cauldron (since you pour all of the content of the cauldron, this previous concoction can no longer be used for any of your next concoctions). Finally, you stir this cauldron with your broom and take a vial of the concoction to test on your minions later. The remaining concoction remains in this cauldron, and can be poured into another cauldron later. “What is the number of recipes you will concoct this way today?”, you asked yourself..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line contains a non-negative integer $2 \\leq N \\leq 200\\, 000$, giving the total number of recipes you have. Thereafter follow $N$ lines, the $i$-th line describes recipe number $i$. Each of these lines is a single space separated list of integers. Each of these lines begins with an integer $1 \\leq M$, denoting the number of ingredients required to make this recipe. Then, $M$ integers follow, describing the required ingredients. The ingredients are identified by integers between $0$ and $500\\, 000$, inclusively, with different integers denoting different ingredients. For each recipe, all of its ingredients will be distinct. The sum of $M$ over all recipes will be no greater than $500\\, 000$..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: Print the number of recipes you will concoct. Sample Data Explanation In the first example, the first potion can be concocted, since both ingredients were not used so far. Thus, you will concoct this potion. The second potion will also be concocted for the same reason. The third potion cannot be concocted, since ingredient $1$ is no longer present, and is inside a cauldron mixed with another ingredient not present in the recipe. The fourth potion can be concocted by pouring the content of the cauldrons used for the first and second concoctions, and then adding ingredient $5$, which has remained unused so far. The last potion cannot be concocted, since the content of the cauldron for the first potion has all been poured when making the fourth potion and thus is now mixed with other ingredients not present in the recipe. For the second example, since the first potion can be concocted, it has to be concocted. Thus, the second and third potions can no longer be concocted.  \n",

      "Here is the problem description: Note that this is an easier version of the problem snapperhard The Snapper is a clever little device that, on one side, plugs its input plug into an output socket, and, on the other side, exposes an output socket for plugging in a light or other device. When a Snapper is in the ON state and is receiving power from its input plug, then the device connected to its output socket is receiving power as well. When you snap your fingers – making a clicking sound – any Snapper receiving power at the time of the snap toggles between the ON and OFF states. In hopes of destroying the universe by means of a singularity, I have purchased $N$ Snapper devices and chained them together by plugging the first one into a power socket, the second one into the first one, and so on. The light is plugged into the $N$th Snapper. Initially, all the Snappers are in the OFF state, so only the first one is receiving power from the socket, and the light is off. I snap my fingers once, which toggles the first Snapper into the ON state and gives power to the second one. I snap my fingers again, which toggles both Snappers and then promptly cuts power off from the second one, leaving it in the ON state, but with no power. I snap my fingers the third time, which toggles the first Snapper again and gives power to the second one. Now both Snappers are in the ON state, and if my light is plugged into the second Snapper it will be on. I keep doing this for hours. Will the light be on or off after I have snapped my fingers $K$ times? The light is on if and only if it’s receiving power from the Snapper it’s plugged into..\n",

Today, it is neither poor nor peaceful. What happened? One sunny morning, not too long ago, all inhabitants of Gem Island woke up to a surprise. That morning, each of them suddenly held one sparkling gem in their hand. The gems had magically appeared overnight. This was cause for much rejoicing – everybody was suddenly rich, they could finally afford all the things they had ever dreamed of, and the name of their island made so much more sense now. The next morning, one of the inhabitants woke up to another surprise – her gem had magically split into two gems! The same thing happened on each of the following nights, when exactly one of the gems (apparently uniformly at random among all the gems on the island) would split into two. After a while, the inhabitants of Gem Island possessed a widely varying number of gems. Some had a lot and many had only a few. How come some inhabitants had more gems than others? Did they cheat, were they just lucky, or was something else at work? The island elders have asked for your help. They want you to determine if the uneven distribution of gems is explained by pure chance. If so, that would greatly reduce tensions on the island. The island has $n$ inhabitants. You are to determine the gem distribution after $d$ nights of gem splitting. In particular, you are interested in the expected number of gems collectively held by the $r$ people with the largest numbers of gems. More formally, suppose that after $d$ nights the numbers of gems held by the $n$ inhabitants are listed in non-increasing order as $a_1 \\ge a_2 \\ge \\ldots \\ge a_ n$.

      "Here is the problem description: Image by Pattarisara Suvichanarakul (iStock); Used under license   An airline tracks costs of flights between $n$ different cities in a table. The cities are numbered from $1$ to $n$. In the table, the entry in $\\textrm{row}~ i$ and $\\textrm{column}~ j$ represents the cost of a direct flight from $\\textrm{city}~ i$ to $\\textrm{city}~ j$. However, if there is no direct flight between these two cities, then a value of $-1$ is displayed in the table. A manager for the airline has decided that the table is too hard to read with all the $-1$ values; she does not like all the negativity. Instead, she would prefer a list of the flight prices for just the cities for which there are direct flights. Each entry in the list should specify the city from which the flight departs, the city at which the flight lands, and the price for the flight. The list should be sorted in increasing order by departure city, and if there is more than one flight departing from a city, then ties should be broken by the arrival city in increasing order. For example, the table on the left below should be turned into the list on the right. This matches the first sample input/output.   .\n",

A value of $-1$ is used to indicate that there is no direct flight from $\\textrm{city}~ i$ to $\\textrm{city}~ j$. It is guaranteed that there is no direct flight departing from and arriving at the same city. All costs will be strictly positive integers less than $10\\, 000$. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one direct flight represented in the table..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Videopoker is the slot machine variant of the currently immensely popular game of poker. It is a variant on draw poker. In this game the player gets a hand consisting of five cards randomly drawn from a standard $52$-card deck. From this hand, the player may discard any number of cards (between $0$ and $5$, inclusive), and change them for new cards randomly drawn from the remainder of the deck. After that, the hand is evaluated and the player is rewarded according to a payout structure. A common payout structure is as follows:     hand   payout     one pair   1     two pairs   2     three of a kind   3     straight   4     flush   5     full house   10     four of a kind   25     straight flush   100     royal flush   250     Once you know the payout structure, you can determine for a given hand which cards you must change to maximize your expected reward.

One line with one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10$): the number of starting hands to follow.   $n$ lines, each describing a starting hand. A hand consists of five space separated tokens of the form Xs, with X being the rank (‘2’ ‘9’, ‘T’, ‘J’, ‘Q’, ‘K’ or ‘A’) and s being the suit (‘c’, ‘d’, ‘h’ or ‘s’).  .\n",

Poker hand rankings For those of you not familiar with the game of poker, here follow explanations of the different poker hand rankings:   “one pair”consists of two cards of the same rank and three unmatched cards, e.g. Ah As Tc 8h 2c;   “two pairs” consists of two cards of the same rank, two cards of a different same rank and an unmatched card, e.g. Ah As Th Ts 3c;   “three of a kind” consists of three cards of the same rank and two unmatched cards, e.g. Kc Kh Ks 6c 5s;   a “straight” consists of five cards of sequential rank in more than one suit, e.g. Jd Ts 9c 8d 7h. The ace can be used as low or high card, so straights from ace to five and from ten to ace can be formed;   a “flush” consists of five cards of the same suit, that are not in sequential rank, e.g. Ks Qs 8s 5s 3s;   a “full house” consists of three cards of the same rank and two cards of a different same rank, e.g. Js Jh Jc 4s 4c;   “four of a kind” consists of four cards of the same rank and an unmatched card, e.g. 7h 7c 7s 7d 5c;   a “straight flush” consists of five cards that form both a straight and a flush and that is not a royal flush, e.g. 7h 6h 5h 4h 3h;   a “royal flush” consists of five cards that form both a straight from ten to ace and a flush, e.g. As Ks Qs Js Ts.    \n",

Ackbar has committed all of their ships, the ships being MC80 starships, CR90 corvettes, Dornic attack ships, YT-2400 light frigates and various smaller attack ships like T-65B X-wings. What General Ackbar doesn’t know is that Han Solo and his team died in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the energy core of the protective shield. Furthermore Admiral Piett has set up a trap so the Empire can be rid of the rebels once and for all. This well planned trap consists of explosives that the admiral has placed at the locations where the rebel fleet comes out of their hyperjumps. Since General Ackbar had a mild stroke when he discovered the trap, he’s incapable of assessing the damage to the fleet. Can you help him?.\n",

The first three numbers $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$ denote the position of the $i$-th ship in three-dimensional space and $r_i$ is its explosive radius. Next there is a line containing a single integer $M$. On the next $M$ lines are descriptions of the admiral’s bombs where the $j$-th line contains four integers $x_j,y_j,z_j$ and $r_j$.

The first sample contains one spaceship, located at $(0,0,0)$ and having radius $3$, and two bombs. The first bomb is located at $(2,3-3)$ and has explosive radius $3$. The second bomb is located at $(-2,2,2)$ and has explosive radius $2$. As can be seen on the image the first bomb has no effect on the ship but the second is powerful enough to blow up the spaceship. Thus the output is $0$ since no ship survived. In the second sample no ships and bombs intersect, so the only ship survives. In the last input the fourth bomb causes the second ship to explode.

While the bicycle could ride fine downhill, the pedals were broken and he had to walk with the bicycle on the uphill roads. Now Lazy Smurf needs your help finding the path to Smurfette which makes him have to walk uphill the least. As everyone knows, all of Gothenburg can be represented as a graph 1: $N$ spots (numbered from $1$ to $N$), and $M$ roads (each road going directly between two spots). Each spot in the city has a known height $h_ i$, and if there is a direct road between spot $i$ and $j$, the height difference $h_ i-h_ j$ is the uphill distance to walk (if it is positive). To minimize the amount Lazy Smurf has to walk with the bicycle, we want to find the path from his location to Smurfette’s which minimizes the total height difference for all roads between their locations, counting downhill and flat roads as $0$..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Image by Ferenz (Shutterstock), Used under license   Dio’s parents have recently retired to a villa in Greece, leaving him in charge of the family business, a home decor store specializing in ancient pottery (and a proud member of ICPC, the International Consortium of Pottery Companies). Dio enjoys interacting with customers, and always experiences a sense of satisfaction when he makes a sale. In idle moments, he often finds himself thinking about recent transactions, and, in particular, about the specific prices that customers have paid. In the midst of such musings, it strikes him that some prices are actually impossible, i.e., there are prices (perfectly sensible-sounding prices) that no customer will ever end up paying. The reason is that although Dio has essentially unlimited discretion in choosing the amount written on the price tag attached to each item in his store, this is the pre-tax price, whereas the actual price that a customer pays for an item is the after-tax price. The difference between the two is what creates the possibility of impossible prices. Because the monetary system in Dio’s country is based on dollars and cents, a price (pre-tax or after-tax) is always a positive real number with exactly two digits after the decimal point. The tax rate, $T$, which is expressed as a percentage, is fixed by the government. It follows that if $x$ is a pre-tax price, then the resulting after-tax price, $\\mathrm{ATP}(x)$, is given by\\[ \\mathrm{ATP}(x) = \\langle \\, x (1 + T/100) \\, \\rangle \\] where $\\langle \\ \\rangle $ means “round to the nearest cent.” For example, if $x = 2.24$ and the tax rate is $10\\% $, then\\[ \\mathrm{ATP}(x) = \\langle \\, 2.24 (1 + 10/100) \\, \\rangle = \\langle \\, 2.24 \\cdot 1.1 \\, \\rangle = \\langle \\, 2.464 \\, \\rangle = 2.46 \\] However, if $x$ is increased by $1$ cent (the smallest possible increment), then $x = 2.25$ and\\[ \\mathrm{ATP}(x) = \\langle \\, 2.25 \\cdot 1.1 \\, \\rangle = \\langle \\, 2.475 \\, \\rangle = 2.48 \\] Notice that $2.47$ was skipped, i.e., $2.47$ is an impossible price when the tax rate is $10\\% $. Given a tax rate, $T$, and a closed interval $[A, B]$, where $A$ and $B$ are prices and $A \\leq B$, help Dio determine how many prices in the interval are in fact impossible. Rounding Rule: If $p$ is a price, then the real numbers that round to $p$ are exactly those that lie in the half-open interval $[p - 0.005, p + 0.005)$..\n",

Every real number will have exactly two digits after the decimal point..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Hypercube graphs are fascinatingly regular, hence you have devoted a lot of time studying the mathematics related to them. The vertices of a hypercube graph of dimension $n$ are all binary strings of length $n$, and two vertices are connected if they differ in a single position. There are many interesting relationships between hypercube graphs and error-correcting code. One such relationship concerns the $n$-bit Gray Code, which is an ordering of the binary strings of length $n$, defined recursively as follows. The sequence of words in the $n$-bit code first consists of the words of the $(n-1)$-bit code, each prepended by a $0$, followed by the same words in reverse order, each prepended by a $1$. The $1$-bit Gray Code just consists of a $0$ and a $1$. For example the $3$-bit Gray Code is the following sequence:\\[ 000,001,011,010,110,111,101,100 \\] Now, the $n$-bit Gray Code forms a Hamiltonian path in the $n$-dimensional hypercube, i.e., a path that visits every vertex exactly once (see Figure 1).     Figure 1: The $3$-dimensional hypercube and the Hamiltonian path corresponding to the $3$-bit Gray Code.    You wonder how many vertices there are between the vertices $0^ n$ ($n$ zeros) and $1^ n$ ($n$ ones) on that path. Obviously it will be somewhere between $2^{n-1}-1$ and $2^ n-2$, since in general $0^ n$ is the first vertex, and $1^ n$ is somewhere in the second half of the path. After finding an elegant answer to this question you ask yourself whether you can generalise the answer by writing a program that can determine the number of vertices between two arbitrary vertices of the hypercube, in the path corresponding to the Gray Code..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: An instructor may use curved score to grade a student’s performance. Assume a student’s original score is $x$ out of a total of $100$. One of the curving methods is to apply to $x$ the curving function $f(x) = 10\\sqrt {x}$. The function may be applied $k \\geq 0$ times. For better score readability, the result is rounded to the next integer and the final curved score is $y = \\lceil f^ k(x) \\rceil $.  For example, if the curving function is applied $k = 3$ times to $x = 80$, it changes the score to\\begin{align*} f^3(80) & = f^2(f(80)) = f^2(89.4427) \\\\ & = f(f(89.4427)) = f(94.5742) = 97.2492. \\end{align*} So the curved score is $y = \\lceil 97.2492 \\rceil = 98$. John wants to curve a student’s score $x$ using this method so that the curved score $y$ is between $y_{low}$ and $y_{high}$. How many times should he apply the curving function? In particular, what are the minimum and maximum choices of $k$, so that $y_{low} \\leq y \\leq y_{high}$?.\n",

      "Here is the problem description: The Arca Carania Mountain national park is opening up for tourist traffic. The national park has a number of sites worth seeing and roads that connect pairs of sites. The park commissioners have put together a set of round tours in the park in which visitors can ride buses to view various sites. Each round tour starts at some site (potentially different sites for different tours), visits a number of other sites without repeating any, and then returns to where it started. At least 3 different sites are visited in each round tour. At least one round tour is possible in the national park. The park commissioners have decided that, for any given road, all buses will be operated by a single company. The commissioners do not want to be accused of favoritism, so they want to be sure that each possible round tour in the park has exactly the same number of roads assigned to each bus company. They realize this may be difficult to achieve. Thus, they want to learn what numbers of bus companies allow for a valid assignment of companies to roads. Consider Sample Input 1, which is illustrated in Figure 1. There are a total of three round tours for these sites. Some company is assigned road 1-3. It must also be assigned some road on the round tour 1-2-3-4-1, say 2-3. But then it is assigned to two of the three roads on the round tour 1-2-3-1, and no other company can match this – so there can be no other companies. In Sample Input 2 there is only one round tour, so it is enough to assign the roads of this tour equally between companies.     Figure 1: Sample Input 1.   .\n",

Following that are $m$ lines, each containing two integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$ ($1 \\leq a_ i < b_ i \\leq n$), meaning the sites $a_ i$ and $b_ i$ are connected by a bidirectional road.

      "Here is the problem description: The king wants bridges built and he wants them built as quickly as possible. The king owns an $N \\times M$ grid of land with each cell separated from its adjacent cells by a river running between them and he wants you to figure out how many man-hours of work it will take to build enough bridges to connect every island. Some cells are actually lakes and need not have a bridge built to them. Some of the islands are forests where trees are abundant. Located in the top left corner is the base camp, which is always a forest. A bridge can only be built between two islands if they are vertically or horizontally adjacent, and one of the islands is accessible from the base camp through the bridges that are already built. The number of man-hours it takes to build a bridge is the number of bridges the builders have to cross to get from the nearest forest to the island you’re building to, including the bridge being built. Builders can only walk between two islands if there is already a bridge between them. The king has already ensured that there is at least one way to connect all the islands. Write a program that, given a map of the islands, will output the minimum number of man-hours required to connect all islands. Consider the following example. A green tile indicates a forest, gray indicates an empty island, and blue indicates water.      One optimal solution starts out by building the following bridges from the base camp forest.      This has a cost of $1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 13$. Now since the forest at row $3$, column $3$ is connected to base camp, we can build bridges from there. One optimal solution connects the rest of the islands with bridges built from this forest.      This has a cost of $2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 11$.

You can assume that Karel’s world is never larger than $20 \\times 20$ squares and that there will never be more than $10$ beepers to pick up.

After a long day at work you like to watch the birds on the wire from your balcony. Some time ago you noticed that they don’t like to sit closer than $d$ centimetres from each other. In addition, they cannot sit closer than 6 centimetres to any of the poles, since there are spikes attached to the pole to keep it clean from faeces that would otherwise damage and weaken it. You start wondering how many more birds can possibly sit on the wire. Task Given numbers $\\ell $ and $d$, how many additional birds can sit on the wire given the positions of the birds already on the wire? For the purposes of this problem we assume that the birds have zero width..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Your game development studio, Ad Hoc Entertainment, is currently working on a billiards-based app they’re calling Pool Shark. Players face a sequence of increasingly devious pool puzzles in which they need to carefully position and aim a single billiards shot to sink multiple pool balls. You’ve just done the first round of user testing and the feedback is terrible — players complain that the physics of your pool game is neither fun nor intuitive. After digging into it, you realize that the problem isn’t that your physics code is bad, but rather that most people just don’t have much intuition about how physics works. Fortunately, no one requires your physics to be realistic. After this liberating realization, your team experiments with a few models, eventually settling on the following rule for how to resolve pool-ball collisions: When a moving pool ball B hits a stationary ball A, A begins moving in the direction given by the vector from the center of B to the center of A at the time of the collision. Ball B’s new velocity vector is B’s original vector reflected across A’s new vector (Figure H.1). Note that A’s resulting vector is what real physics predicts, but B’s is not (unless A is glued to the table or has infinite mass). For the purposes of this problem, the speed at which the balls move is irrelevant.               Figure H.1     Figure H.2     This actually allows for more interesting challenges, but requires new code to determine whether a particular level is feasible. You’ve been tasked with solving a very particular case: Three balls labelled $1$, $2$, and $3$ are placed on a table with width $w$ and length $l$ (Figure H.2). The player must place the cue ball somewhere on a dashed line lying $h$ units above the bottom edge of the table. The goal is to pick a distance $d$ from the left side, and an angle $\\theta $ such that when the cue ball is shot, the following events happen:   The cue ball strikes ball $1$, and then ricochets into ball $2$, sinking ball $2$ in the top left hole.   Ball $1$, having been struck by the cue ball, hits ball $3$, sinking ball $3$ in the top right hole.   For simplicity, assume that sinking a ball requires the center of the ball to pass directly over the center of the hole. Further assume that the table has no sides — a ball that goes out of the $w$-by-$l$ region simply falls into a digital abyss — and thus you don’t need to worry about balls colliding with the table itself. You need to write a program that, given values for $w$, $l$, $h$, the position of balls $1$–$3$, and the radius $r$ of the balls, determines whether the trick shot is possible..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The input begins with a line containing two positive integers $w$ $l$, the width and length of the pool table, where $w, l \\leq 120$. The left hole is at location $(0,l)$ and the right hole is at location $(w,l)$. The next line will contain 8 positive integers $r$ $x_1$ $y_1$ $x_2$ $y_2$ $x_3$ $y_3$ $h$, where $r \\leq 5$ is the radius of all the balls (including the cue ball), $x_ i$ $y_ i$ is the location of ball $i,\\, 1 \\leq i \\leq 3$, and $h$ is the distance the dashed line is from the front of the pool table (see the figure above, where $r \\leq h \\leq (1/2)l$). No two balls will ever overlap, though they may touch at a point, and all balls will lie between the dashed line and the back of the table. All balls will lie completely on the table, and the cue ball must also lie completely on the table (otherwise the shot is impossible)..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: For each test case, display the distance $d$ to place the ball on the dashed line and the angle $\\theta $ to shoot the ball, or the word “impossible” if the trick shot cannot be done. Output $\\theta $ in degrees, and round both $d$ and $\\theta $ to the nearest hundredth. Always show two digits after the decimal point, even if the digits are zero.  \n",

Many sequences may look random but upon closer inspection we can find hidden regularities in the occurrence of the numbers.

We’ll call features like this triple correlations and we’ll represent it as $4(1)4(3)3$, where the numbers in parentheses indicate how far away each number on either side of the parentheses must be. More precisely, a sequence of $p$ digits has an $a(n)b(m)c$ triple correlation if   any time there is an $a$ followed $n$ locations later by a $b$ there is always a $c$ located $m$ locations after the $b$ unless $b$’s location is within distance $m-1$ of the end of the sequence.   any time there is a $b$ followed $m$ locations later by a $c$ there is always an $a$ located $n$ locations before the $b$ unless $b$’s location is within distance $n-1$ of the beginning of the sequence.   any time there is an $a$ followed $n+m$ locations later by a $c$ there is always a $b$ located $n$ locations after the $a$.   the correlation occurs at least $\\lceil p/40 \\rceil + 1$ times, where $\\lceil x \\rceil $ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.

However, last night the ZomBs invaded her house! The next day, when Ms. Alice woke up, she found that the ZomBs had eaten all the $b$s! They had eaten the middle number on all her factoring questions that she spent all week making for her students. Ms. Alice decided that instead of remaking all her questions, she would just ask her students how many possible values there are for $b$ that would make the expression $ax^2+bx+c$ factorable. The expression $ax^2+bx+c$ is factorable if and only if the expression $ax^2+bx+c$ is able to be successfully rewritten in the form $(dx+ e)(fx + g)$, where $a,b,c,d,e,f,g$ are integers.

      "Here is the problem description: Prime Numbers by geralt, Pixabay  An integer $p$ is a prime number if it is larger than $1$ and its only positive divisors are $1$ and $p$. For example, $10$ is not a prime because its positive divisors are $1$, $2$, $5$, and $10$. However, $11$ is a prime because its only positive divisors are $1$ and $11$. In the same vein you can see that $2$, $3$, and $17$ are primes, but $4$, $9$, and $15$ are not prime. Counting all the primes between $1$ and $100$ shows that there are $25$ prime numbers smaller than $100$. With a little more work one can show that there are $168$ prime numbers smaller than $1\\, 000$. Given two integers, $a$ and $b$, count the number of primes smaller than or equal to $b$ and larger than or equal to $a$..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$ is the founder of ACM (Association of Cats and Magical Lights). This is the story of the founding of ACM. It is the second half of the year again and Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$ is looking forward to Christmas. When people think of Christmas, Christmas trees will surely come into the picture. This year, Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$ decides to decorate a Christmas tree with $N$ LED lights with up to 100 different colours. Each LED light can only have a single colour as Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$ is too poor to afford more sophisticated models of LED lights. Being a programmer himself, Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$ LED lights are arranged in a tree formation on the Christmas tree. That being said, each LED light can be represented as a node and the wires between $2$ LED lights can be represented as an edge. The whole formation consists of $N$ nodes fully connected by $N-1$ edges. The nodes are labelled from $1$ to $N$ and each node can hold colour denoted as $1$ to $100$. It is noted that each LED is connected to every other LED directly or indirectly by wires and the tree formed is rooted at node $1$. Hubert the Cow finds that Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$ Christmas tree is too boring because it lacks some magical colours. A magical colour in a subtree is defined as a colour whereby there is an odd number of LEDs with that particular colour within the subtree only.    In the tree to the right, the subtree of node $1$ has $3$ white nodes and $4$ black nodes. As such, white is a magical colour for the subtree of node $1$. However, the subtree of node $3$ has $1$ white node and $1$ black node, thus the number of magical colour of the subtree of node $3$ is $2$. In addition, all leaf nodes of the tree have $1$ magical colour by definition.  In order to improve on his Christmas tree decorations, Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$ intends to modify the colours of the LED lights on the tree. However, he does not know how to count how many magical colours there are. Your task, is now to answer how many magical colours there are in a subtree requested by Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$. This will be done in between Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$ modifications. There will be $Q$ queries and modifications in total. Soon after this, Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$ Christmas tree with these magical lights become so popular and Rar the Cat$^($™$^)$ founded ACM to further spread the adoption of such trees worldwide..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Your university’s board game club just hosted a Checkers tournament, and you were assigned to take notes on the games. Unfortunately, while walking home, you dropped all of your papers into a puddle! Disaster! Much of what you wrote is now unreadable; all you have left are some lists of moves played in the middle of various games. Is there some way you can reconstruct what happened in those games? You had better fix things fast, or they will demote you to Tic-Tac-Toe recordkeeper! Checkers (or English Draughts) is a well-known board game with simple rules. It is played on the dark squares of an $8\\times 8$ checkerboard. There are two players, Black and White, who alternate turns moving their pieces (all of Black’s pieces are black and all of White’s pieces are white). Each piece occupies a single dark square, and can be either a normal man or a promoted king. A turn consists of choosing one piece and moving it in one of two ways:   Shifting it diagonally to an unoccupied adjacent dark square, as shown in Figure a. This is called a simple move. If the piece is a man, it can move only in the two diagonal directions towards the opposing side of the board (towards the bottom for Black, the top for White). If the piece is a king, it can move in all four diagonal directions.   Jumping over an adjacent enemy piece to an unoccupied square immediately on the other side, then removing (capturing) that piece. Men can jump only in the two directions described above, while kings can jump in all four. The player can then repeat this step, continuing to jump with the same piece as long as there are properly-positioned enemy pieces to capture. Such a sequence of one or more jumps is called a jump move. Figure b shows a jump move comprising three jumps.          (a) Simple move          (b) Jump move          (c) Board numbering    Figure 1: (a), (b) The first two moves in Sample Input 1. The larger pieces are kings and the smaller ones are men. Black sits at the top and White at the bottom. (c) Numbering used in the input.    In Checkers, captures are forced moves. If a jump move is available at the start of a player’s turn, they must jump, and cannot stop jumping with that piece until it has no more possible jumps. They are free to choose which piece to jump with, and where, if there are multiple possibilities. In Figure b, Black could not have made any other move. If a man reaches the farthest row from its player (that is, a black man reaches the bottom row or a white man reaches the top row), it is removed from the board and replaced by a king of the same color (it is said to be promoted), and the turn ends. A piece cannot be promoted and then jump backwards as a new king in the same turn. Given a list of moves, find a setup of pieces such that the moves can be legally played in sequence starting from that setup. This setup may not have black men on the bottom row or white men on the top row, since they would have been promoted to kings already. You need only ensure that the rules above are obeyed; you do not need to ensure that this setup is reachable in a real game of Checkers..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line of input contains a character $c$ and an integer $n$, where $c \\in \\{ \\texttt{B}, \\texttt{W}\\} $ indicates which player makes the first move (Black or White respectively) and $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) is the number of moves in the list. Then follow $n$ lines, each of which describes a move in the standard Checkers notation defined below. The dark squares are identified by numbers $1$–$32$, as shown in Figure c. A simple move from square $a$ to square $b$ is written as $a$-$b$. A jump move starting at $a$ and jumping to $b_1, b_2, \\dots , b_ k$ is written as $a$x$b_1$x$b_2$x$\\cdots $x$b_ k$. There is always a valid solution for the given set of moves..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: Output two boards side-by-side (separated by a space), giving the positions of all pieces on the board before (on the left) and after (on the right) the given moves. Use ‘-’ for light squares, ‘.’ for empty dark squares, lowercase ‘b’ and ‘w’ for black and white men, and uppercase ‘B’ and ‘W’ for black and white kings. If there is more than one valid solution, any one is acceptable.  \n",

During their stay, various events which are too horrible to mention occurred. The net result was that the last evening of the trip ended with a momentous exchange of “I never want to see you again!”s. A quick calculation tells you it may have been said almost $50$ million times! Back home in Scandinavia, our group of ex-friends realize that they haven’t split the costs incurred during the trip evenly. Some people may be out several thousand crowns. Settling the debts turns out to be a bit more problematic than it ought to be, as many in the group no longer wish to speak to one another, and even less to give each other money. Naturally, you want to help out, so you ask each person to tell you how much money she owes or is owed, and whom she is still friends with.

      "Here is the problem description: Photo from flickr.com   Lárus is a middle manager at a stellar company, He manages $n$ members of the staff, all of which are related to him except for one. When a new assignment pops up, Lárus is in charge of assigning it to a member of the staff. Lárus wants to minimise the work his relatives must do. However, he cannot simply pick the same person every time. To ensure people do not believe Lárus is practising nepotism, He lines the people up in a circle and uses a mantra to pick a person at random for the assignment. First he picks a staff member at which to point and recites the first word. He then recites the rest of the mantra and points to the next staff member to the right for each word that he recites. The mantra is as follows:  Úllen dúllen doff kikke lane koff koffe lane bikke bane úllen dúllen doff.  How can Lárus line up the staff members so that his relatives do not get the assignment?.\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line of input contains one integer $n$, the number of staff members. Then $n$ lines follow, where each line contains one name. The first name is the staff member which is not related to Lárus. You may assume that each name is unique and consists of $1$ to $10$ lowercase English letters..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: Output $n$ lines, where each line contains one name of a staff member and such that no name is repeated. Lárus will use the ordering you output to recite the mantra and pick the staff member receiving the assignment. If the ordering you output results in one of his relatives being picked, then your solution will be considered wrong. Scoring The number of staff members, $n$, can range from $1$ to $20$. There exists a test group for each possible value of $n$ and each group is worth $5$ points. You must solve all the test cases in a test group to earn the points for that group. Explanation of samples In the first sample, one possible solution is to iterate through the same order as the input, resulting in the following steps:   Úllen: Arnar   dúllen: Atli   doff: Bjarni   kikke: Bjarki   lane: Hannes   koff: Unnar   koffe: Arnar   lane: Atli   bikke: Bjarni   bane: Bjarki   úllen: Hannes   dúllen: Unnar   doff: Arnar   Since Arnar ends up being the final choice, the output is considered correct. In the second sample, one possible answer is to iterate through the following order:   Úllen: v   dúllen: x   doff: y   kikke: a   lane: b   koff: c   koffe: p   lane: q   bikke: r   bane: s   úllen: t   dúllen: u   doff: z   In the end, z is chosen and the output is considered correct. Note that many other correct outputs exist and that in the second sample we do not reach the final two values in the order given.  \n",

      "Here is the problem description: John likes simple ciphers. He had been using the “Caesar” cipher to encrypt his diary until recently, when he learned a hard lesson about its strength by catching his sister Mary browsing through the diary without any problems. Rapidly searching for an alternative, John found a solution: the famous “Autokey” cipher. He uses a version that takes the $26$ lower-case letters ‘a’–‘z’ and internally translates them in alphabetical order to the numbers $0$ to $25$. The encryption key $k$ begins with a secret prefix of $n$ letters. Each of the remaining letters of the key is copied from the letters of the plaintext $a$, so that $k_{n+i} = a_{i}$ for $i \\geq 1$. Encryption of the plaintext $a$ to the ciphertext $b$ follows the formula $b_ i = a_ i + k_ i \\bmod 26$. Mary is not easily discouraged. She was able to get a peek at the last $n$ letters John typed into his diary on the family computer before he noticed her, quickly encrypted the text document with a click, and left. This could be her chance..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: The popular game of Sudoku requires the player to fill in a $9$-by-$9$ board using the digits $1$ through $9$, such that no row, column, or $3$-by-$3$ square (see diagram) has more than one copy of each digit. The player is given a partially completed board and must fill in the blank squares. Designing a Sudoku puzzle appears easy – just start with a solved, valid puzzle, and erase the digits in some of the squares. However, if the designer erases too many squares, then there might be multiple solutions. This can make solving the puzzle more difficult, and potentially less fun. Thus, you should write a program to help a designer find out if their puzzle has exactly one solution.      3       5       7       4       9       1       6       2       8        9       2       4       8       6       7       3       5       1        6       1       8       5       2       3       4       7       9        1       6       9       2       7       5       8       3       4        7       4       5       9       3       8       1       6       2        8       3       2       6       1       4       7       9       5        2       9       1       3       8       6       5       4       7        5       7       6       1       4       2       9       8       3        4       8       3       7       5       9       2       1       6      .\n",

The cards are organized in pairs: there are $N/2$ different pictures, each picture occurring on exactly two cards. At the beginning of the game, the cards are shuffled and laid face down on the table. Players then take turns in guessing a pair of cards with the same picture. Each turn consists of picking a face-down card and turning it over to reveal its picture, then picking another face-down card and turning that card over as well. If the pictures on the two turned cards are identical, the cards remain face-up, the player scores a point and may take another turn. If the pictures are different, both cards are turned face-down again and the turn goes to the next player. It is now your turn! Given a description of all previous actions in the game, pick as many matching pairs as possible.     Figure 1: Illustration of the first example input.

      "Here is the problem description: Finding the convex hull of a set of points is an important problem that is often part of a larger problem. There are many algorithms for finding the convex hull. Since problems involving the convex hull sometimes appear in the ACM World Finals, it is a good idea for contestants to know some of these algorithms. Finding the convex hull of a set of points in the plane can be divided into two sub-tasks. First, given a set of points, find a subset of those points that, when joined with line segments, form a convex polygon that encloses all of the original points. Second, output the points of the convex hull in order, walking counter-clockwise around the polygon. In this problem, the first sub-task has already been done for you, and your program should complete the second sub-task. That is, given the points that are known to lie on the convex hull, output them in order walking counter-clockwise around the hull..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line of input contains a single integer $3 \\le n \\le 100\\, 000$, the number of points. The following $n$ lines of input each describe a point. Each of these lines contains two integers and either a Y or an N, separated by spaces. The two integers specify the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the point. A Y indicates that the point is on the convex hull of all the points, and a N indicates that it is not. The $x$- and $y$-coordinates of each point will be no less than $-1\\, 000\\, 000\\, 000$ and no greater than $1\\, 000\\, 000\\, 000$. No point will appear more than once in the input. The points in the input will never all lie on a line..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: First, output a line containing a single integer $m$, the number of points on the convex hull. Next output $m$ lines, each describing a point on the convex hull, in counter-clockwise order around the hull. Each of these lines should contain the $x$-coordinate of the point, followed by a space, followed by the $y$-coordinate of the point. Start with the point on the hull whose $x$-coordinate is minimal. If there are multiple such points, start with the one whose $y$-coordinate is minimal.  \n",

      "Here is the problem description: Picture by Martin Fisch via Flickr, cc by-sa  It is not an easy life being an online judge. Kattis has lots of things to do and sometimes all her tasks can be overwhelming. For instance, to judge a submission, Kattis has to run all over cyberspace to figure out an appropriate verdict. First she has to go to Compiler Plaza and haggle with the merchants there to see if anyone is willing to compile the source code for her. Next she needs to go to the Data Market to pick up some fresh test cases to feed to the submission. With these things done she goes to the CPU track to let the code run for a while. Then she may have to do a quick stop at the hospital to patch the submission up in case it crashed. And it seems like it will never stop...  But help is on its way! Kattis has recently acquired a number of programmable catbots, which she can send off on all these errands instead of going herself. Each catbot is equipped with a top-of-the-line MeowFi antenna, with which it can instantly transfer any materials it picks up at a location to all the other catbots. This means that different catbots could visit the different locations, as long as the locations are visited in order. Kattis is very concerned about the future of our planet, and wants to perform her task in a resource-efficient way. The main resource used in this process is the energy needed for the catbots to move from place to place. Thus, Kattis wants to minimize the total number of steps taken by all the catbots. For the purposes of this problem, cyberspace is a rectangular grid, in which catbots can move up, down, left, and right. Some squares in the grid are impassable walls. All catbots start at Kattis HQ, and must end at Kattis HQ after all the tasks are done. Your task is to write a program to find the minimum total number of steps, given the map of cyberspace and the tasks that need to be done. A task is considered performed if there is a catbot in the location of the task after the previous task has been performed. E.g., if we first move a catbot to the location of the second task, and then a catbot to the location of the first task, then both the tasks have been performed – the first catbot does not need to re-enter the location of the second task in order to perform it. Consider a grid as in Figure 1 below, with access to two catbots and three places to visit. A good sequence of moves would then be to send the first catbot to location $1$ ($4$ steps), then the other catbot to location $2$ ($2$ steps), then the first catbot from location $1$ to location $3$ ($3$ steps) and finally to send both catbots home again ($5+2$ steps), for a total of $16$ steps.     Figure 1: Illustration of Sample Input 1.   .\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line of input consists of four integers $w$, $h$, $c$, and $t$ ($1 \\le w, h, c, t \\le 200$), where $w$ is the width and $h$ is the height of the cyberspace grid, $c$ is the number of catbots that Kattis has bought, and $t$ is the number of tasks that need to be performed. Then follow $h$ lines, each containing $w$ characters, giving a map of cyberspace. Each character is either a ‘#’ indicating an impassable wall, a ‘K’ indicating Kattis HQ, or a ‘.’ for the remaining positions. There is exactly one ‘K’ in the grid. Then follow $t$ lines. The $i^\\textrm {th}$ of these lines contains two integers $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ ($1 \\le x_ i \\le w$, $1 \\le y_ i \\le h$) indicating that the $i^\\textrm {th}$ location to visit is in column $x_ i$ of row $y_ i$ of the grid. The positions of these locations are not necessarily distinct, but will neither be walls nor Kattis HQ..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Photo by Mark Ramsay   As you might have heard, Gunnar is an old and forgetful researcher. Most of his research is in security and he cares a bit too much about his own security, so for each website he has a different password. It would be very hard for him to remember all passwords, so for every website he only remembers the method he used to create the password. For one of the very important websites he started with a file containing a long list of non-negative integers. Since he very much likes the operation $\\oplus $ (xor), his password is a xor of some integers in the list. Note that the operation xor is defined on boolean values as $0\\oplus 0=1\\oplus 1=0$ and $0\\oplus 1=1\\oplus 0=1$. We can then extend this definition to integers, namely we first write the two integers in binary and then do xor for each two corresponding bits in the numbers. For example the xor of $12=(1100)_2$ and $5=(101)_2$ is $9=(1001)_2$. Instead of addition, we can use the operation xor when summing numbers and we call this modified sum xor-sum. Task Gunnar’s file contains a list of numbers and he selected a subset of the numbers such that its xor-sum is as large as possible. The resulting number was his password. Unfortunately, he forgot the algorithm to find the subset with the largest xor-sum, so he is asking you for help with restoring his password. Of course, he will not tell you for which website this password is..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: A very simplistic scheme, which was used at one time to encode information, is to rotate the characters within an alphabet and rewrite them. ROT13 is the variant in which the characters A-Z are rotated 13 places, and it was a commonly used insecure scheme that attempted to “hide” data in many applications from the late 1990’s and into the early 2000’s. It has been decided by Insecure Inc. to develop a product that “improves” upon this scheme by first reversing the entire string and then rotating it. As an example, if we apply this scheme to string ABCD with a reversal and rotation of 1, after the reversal we would have DCBA and then after rotating that by 1 position we have the result EDCB. Your task is to implement this encoding scheme for strings that contain only capital letters, underscores, and periods. Rotations are to be performed using the alphabet order:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_.  Note that underscore follows Z, and the period follows the underscore. Thus a forward rotation of 1 means A is shifted to B, that is:   A $\\rightarrow $ B   B $\\rightarrow $ C   $\\vdots $   Z $\\rightarrow $ _   _ $\\rightarrow $ .   . $\\rightarrow $ A   Likewise a rotation of 3 means:   A $\\rightarrow $ D   B $\\rightarrow $ E   $\\vdots $   . $\\rightarrow $ C  .\n",

The string is the message to be encrypted, and will consist of 1 to 40 characters, using only capital letters, underscores, and periods. The end of the input will be denoted by a final line with only the number 0..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Frederic Chopin was a Polish music composer who lived from 1810–1849. One of his most famous works was his set of preludes. These $24$ pieces span the $24$ musical keys (there are musically distinct $12$ scale notes, and each may use major or minor tonality). The $12$ distinct scale notes are:\\[ \\begin{array}{|*{12}{c|}} \\hline 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\ A & A\\sharp = B\\flat & B & C & C\\sharp = D\\flat & D & D\\sharp = E\\flat & E & F & F\\sharp = G\\flat & G & G\\sharp = A\\flat \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Five of the notes have two alternate names, as is indicated above with the equals sign (e.g. $C\\sharp = D\\flat $ means that note has two names, $C\\sharp $ and $D\\flat $). Thus, there are $17$ possible names for the scale notes, but only $12$ musically distinct notes. When using one of these as the keynote for a musical key, we can further distinguish between the major and minor tonalities. This gives $34$ possible keys, of which $24$ are musically distinct. In naming his preludes, Chopin used all the keys except for the following $10$ (which were named instead by their alternate names):\\[ \\begin{array}{*{5}{c}} A\\flat \\text { minor} & A\\sharp \\text { major} & A\\sharp \\text { minor} & C\\sharp \\text { major} & D\\flat \\text { minor} \\\\ D\\sharp \\text { major} & D\\sharp \\text { minor} & G\\flat \\text { major} & G\\flat \\text { minor} & G\\sharp \\text { major} \\end{array} \\] Write a program that, given the name of a key, will give an alternate name (if it has an alternate) or report that the key name is unique..\n",
      "Here is the input description: Each input line contains one test case. There are at least one and at most five cases, and the end of input is at the end of file. Each line has the format “note tonality”, where note is one of the $17$ names for the scale notes given above, and tonality is either major or minor. All note names will be upper-case, and the two accidentals ($\\sharp $ and $\\flat $) will be written as # and b, respectively..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: For each case, output ‘Case X:’ (where X is the case number starting at $1$), followed by a space. Then output the alternate key name, if it exists, or print UNIQUE if the key name is unique.  \n",

      "Here is the problem description: Frank lives in London and he really likes games and maths. Lately, he has been playing a game on his mobile phone. It is simple, a sequence of coloured tokens is provided and each turn the player has to combine a pair of adjacent tokens to obtain a new token of certain colour. This process is repeated until the whole sequence results in only one final token. The problem is that not every pair of colours can be merged. There is a set of rules describing the allowed combinations. For example, given the following rules\\begin{equation*} \\begin{matrix} \\text {blue} & + & \\text {yellow} & \\to & \\text {green} \\\\ \\text {yellow} & + & \\text {red} & \\to & \\text {orange} \\\\ \\text {blue} & + & \\text {orange} & \\to & \\text {brown} \\\\ \\end{matrix}\\end{equation*} and the sequence (blue, yellow, red), the game could be finished obtaining a brown token after two steps: $(\\mathtt{blue}, \\mathtt{yellow}, \\mathtt{red}) \\to (\\mathtt{blue}, \\mathtt{orange}) \\to (\\mathtt{brown})$. Frank is now in Valencia attending a famous programming contest and he is waiting for the tram to go to the university. Meanwhile, he is playing this game to fill time but the sun is shining so bright that he can not properly see the screen of his phone. He has some certainty about the possible colour of each token and he is wondering what will be the resulting colour following the most likely play of the game according to his estimation of the input sequence. Given Frank’s estimation of two colours A and B, and the combination $\\texttt{A} + \\texttt{B} \\to \\texttt{C}$, the certainty of the obtained colour C is computed as $\\mathsf{cer}(\\mathtt{C}) = \\mathsf{cer}(\\mathtt{A}) \\cdot \\mathsf{cer}(\\mathtt{B})$..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line contains $R$ ($0 < R \\leq 100$) the number of rules describing the allowed combinations of colours. Each of the following $R$ lines contains three strings $s_1$, $s_2$, $s_3$ representing the combination $s_1 + s_2 \\to s_3$. Next line shows the number of test cases $T$. For each test case an integer $C$ indicates the length of the input sequence of tokens ($0 < C \\leq 500$). Each of the next $C$ lines describes a token, it contains a list of pairs $(k, \\mathsf{cer}(k))$ providing a colour $k$ and its corresponding certainty ($0 < \\textsf{cer}(k) \\leq 1.0$). The list ends with the word END. The sum of the certainties for a certain token always is $1.0$. Every colour in a test case has appeared first in the rules describing the game..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: For each test case, print the resulting colour of the most likely play of the game. If there is no possible combination to finish the game then print GAMEOVER.  \n",

      "Here is the problem description: There are $N$ contestants in a reality TV show. Each contestant is assigned a point value by the judges and receives votes from the audience. The point value given by the judges and the audience’s votes are combined to form a final score for the contestant, in the following way: Let $X$ be the sum of the judge-assigned point values of all contestants. Now suppose a contestant got $J$ points from the judges, and that she received a fraction $Y$ (between 0 and 1, inclusive) of the audience’s votes ($Y$ might be, for example, 0.3). Then that contestant’s final score is $J+XY$. Note that the sum of all contestants’ audience vote fractions must be 1. The contestant with the lowest score is eliminated. Given the points contestants got from judges, your job is to find out, for each contestant, the minimum percentage of audience votes he/she must receive in order for him/her to be guaranteed not to be eliminated, no matter how the rest of the audience’s votes are distributed. If the lowest score is shared by multiple contestants, no contestants will be eliminated..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: People are rarely content with what they have — they always seem to want more. Sometimes this is just healthy ambition, but at other times it is clearly motivated by shallow materialism, or worse. Perhaps we could accept this as an unavoidable aspect of human nature, but the problem is that this mindset appears to be spreading rapidly to the world of mathematics and computer science. For example, greedy algorithms are already well known for taking as much as they can in each iteration, but now geometric shapes are getting in on the act! So far, only regular polygons have been affected, but who knows where it will end? In a regular $n$-sided polygon ($n$-gon), all $n$ sides are of equal length, and all interior angles are the same. (For our purposes, a polygon includes its interior, i.e., it is a solid shape.) In the past, the area of a regular $n$-gon with a given side length was fixed, which was very convenient for students tasked with calculating its area, but now, whenever it gets the chance, a regular $n$-gon will carry out an expansion operation informally known as a “land grab.” A land grab with expansion distance $d > 0$ works as follows: every point outside the regular $n$-gon that is at most distance $d$ from some point in the regular $n$-gon is absorbed and becomes a part of the enlarged $n$-gon. Over time, a regular $n$-gon might carry out many land grabs. (Technically, a regular $n$-gon ceases to be a regular $n$-gon after the first such land grab, but, sadly, it doesn’t notice that its greed is causing it to lose its identity.) Figure $1$ depicts the two test cases in the sample input: a regular $3$-gon (triangle) after a single land grab, and a regular $4$-gon (square) after two land grabs. Given an initial regular $n$-gon and an expansion distance $d$, what is the area of the resulting region after a specified number of land grabs?     Figure 1: Illustration of test cases in Sample Input $1$   .\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line of input contains an integer, $N$, the number of test cases ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100$). Each of the next $N$ lines contains the information for a single regular $n$-gon, given as four space-separated integers, $n$ $\\ell $ $d$ $g$, where $n$ is the initial number of sides ($3 \\leq n \\le 60$), $\\ell $ is the initial side length, $d$ is the expansion distance ($1 \\leq \\ell , d \\leq 10$), and $g$ is the number of land grabs ($0 \\leq g \\leq 20$)..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: For each test case, output the area of the region occupied by the $n$-gon after $g$ land grabs. Each area will be considered correct if it is within $10^{-6}$ of the official answer.  \n",

      "Here is the problem description: You have an upcoming trip to Washington D.C. and you are fascinated with the intricacies of Congressional committee hearings. You wish to attend as many hearings as possible during your trip, and your local representative has provided you with a pass that will get you into the audience of any hearing. But there are some challenges in planning your schedule. Specifically:      There are many committees, and thus many hearings, some of which take place at overlapping times.   While the committees are extremely punctual in terms of when to start a hearing, they are notoriously unpredictable in terms of how long the hearing lasts. Fortunately, rules do not actually allow for a filibuster of a committee hearing, so they cannot last forever.   It is considered rude to enter a hearing that is already underway, or to leave a hearing before it is complete. Given that you do not wish to embarrass the representative who provided your tickets, if you attend you must attend the entire hearing. Fortunately, hearings are very near to each other; as soon as one hearing is done, you can immediately join another hearing that is about to start.   Well in advance of your trip, Congress publishes a schedule of hearings, indicating for each one the time $s$ at which the hearing will start, and then values $a$ and $b$ which represent, respectively, the shortest and longest possible length of that particular hearing. You are to assume that the actual length of the hearing will be a uniformly random integer over the inclusive interval $[a,b]$. Your goal is to develop a strategy that maximizes the expected number of hearings that you can attend during your trip. As an example, consider a situation in which there are four hearings with parameters as follows:     hearing   $s$   $a$   $b$     Social media and elections   1   1   7     NASA missions   3   2   3     Oil and gas exploration   5   1   4     Hurricane recovery efforts   6   10   10     For this schedule, the optimal strategy will allow you to achieve an expected value of $2.125$ hearings. To achieve this, you begin by attending the NASA hearing, which starts at time $3$ and ends with equal probability at either time $5$ or time $6$ (given the hearing length that is uniformly distributed over $\\{ 2, 3\\} $). If the NASA hearing does end at time $5$ you will immediately head to the oil and gas exploration hearing, and there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that hearing will end at time $6$, allowing you to make yet a third hearing (about hurricane recovery efforts). If the NASA hearing instead ends at time $6$, you will go straight to the hurricane hearing. By this strategy you will attend $3$ hearings 12.5% of the time and $2$ hearings the other 87.5% of the time, and thus expected value of $2.125$. Note that if you were to start by attending the social media and elections hearing, you might optimistically make four hearings. However, a careful analysis will demonstrate that if you attend the first hearing, your optimal expected value is only $2.10714$..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The input begins with an integer $n$ that designates the total number of scheduled hearings ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^4$). Following that are $n$ lines, each containing three integers $s$, $a$, and $b$, respectively representing the start time, minimum length, and maximum length of a hearing, such that $1 \\leq s \\leq 10^6$ and $1 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq 10^6$. The hearings will be listed in nondecreasing order of their start times..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Alice and Bob are biologists. They like to group animals using classification trees. A classification tree is a binary tree where the leaves are labeled by the animals. For example, Figure 1 below shows the classification of $5$ animals (labeled as $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$) by Alice and Bob. Alice’s classification has nine groups: $\\{ 1\\} $, $\\{ 2\\} $, $\\{ 3\\} $, $\\{ 4\\} $, $\\{ 5\\} $, $\\{ 2, 5\\} $, $\\{ 1, 2, 5\\} $, $\\{ 1, 2, 3, 5\\} $ and $\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} $.

Figure 1: Illustration of Sample Input 1    As you can observe, Alice and Bob classify the animals differently. Carol is interested to know the number of common groups between the classifications of Alice and Bob. For the above example, there are $7$ common groups. They are: $\\{ 1\\} $, $\\{ 2\\} $, $\\{ 3\\} $, $\\{ 4\\} $, $\\{ 5\\} $, $\\{ 1, 2, 3, 5\\} $ and $\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} $. Carol usually counts the number of common goups by hand. On one day, an outer space alien came to our earth. He asked Alice and Bob to classify aliens in outer space. The number $N$ of aliens can be as big as $100\\, 000$. It is impossible to count the number of common goups by hand now. Can you make a program to help Carol?.\n",

The swimming pool is an axis aligned rectangle whose lower left corner is on the point $(x_l, y_l)$ and the upper right corner is on the point $(x_r, y_r)$. You cannot ever cross the swimming pool, not even on the border. However, it is dark and you do not know the coordinates $(x_l, y_l)$ and $(x_r, y_r)$. Instead, you threw a rock into the pool which revealed that the point $(x_p, y_p)$ is in the pool (or on the boundary). Find a way to walk from the start to the end point along a sequence of line segments, so that you never cross the swimming pool..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line contains two integers $x_s$ and $y_s$ ($-10^4 \\leq x_s, y_s \\leq 10^4$). The second line contains two integers $x_t$ and $y_t$ ($-10^4 \\leq x_t, y_t \\leq 10^4$). The third line contains two integers $x_p$ and $y_p$ ($-10^4 \\leq x_p, y_p \\leq 10^4$). The problem is not adaptive, i.e. for every test case there exist four integers $x_l, y_l, x_r, y_r$ ($-10^4 \\leq x_l < x_r \\leq 10^4$, $-10^4 \\leq y_l < y_r \\leq 10^4$) that constitute a swimming pool. The start and end points are always strictly outside the swimming pool, and the point $(x_p,y_p)$ is inside (or on the border). The start and end points are always distinct. Note that the problem is technically interactive, so the input will not contain an EOF character..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: First, print one integer $N$ ($0 \\leq N \\leq 10$), the number of points in between the start and end point that you want to visit. Then, print $N$ lines, the $i$th containing two integers $x_i, y_i$. These coordinates must satisfy $-10^9 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^9$. Note that these are not the same bounds than on the other coordinates. This means that you will walk along straight line segments between $(x_s, y_s), (x_1, y_1), \\dots , (x_N, y_N), (x_t, y_t)$ such that none of the line segments touch the swimming pool. It can be proven that a solution always exists.  \n",

      "Here is the problem description: Train. Unsplash License by Robin Ulrich on Unsplash  Hercule Poirot, world-renowned detective, was having a lovely cup of tea in his compartment on the Disorient Express when the train conductor rushed in. “We have lost track of the number of train carriages,” exclaimed the conductor. You see, this was no ordinary train, and had no first or last train carriage. Instead, the train carriages were connected to form a large cycle, causing the conductor’s confusion. Hercule thought for a moment. “That is most peculiar,” he said. “But I may be able to help you.” He reached over and grabbed the lamp from the side table. “You see, each train carriage has a light switch like this one. By moving between the carriages and toggling these switches, we can determine the number of train carriages.” The conductor was sceptical, but agreed to try it. “We are in a hurry,” he said, “so please determine $n$, the number of carriages that the train consists of, in at most $3n+500$ steps.” Here a step counts as either moving to an adjacent carriage or toggling a light switch in the current carriage. “The only thing I am certain of is that $n$ is at least $3$ and at most $5000$.”.\n",
      "Here is the input description: This is an interactive problem. Your submission will be run against an interactor, which reads the standard output of your submission and writes to the standard input of your submission. This interaction needs to follow a specific protocol: The interactor first sends an integer $s$ ($s \\in \\{ 0,1\\} $), the state of the light switch in Hercule’s initial carriage. Your submission may then send at most $3n+500$ steps1 for Hercule to carry out, each by printing one line of the form “? $a$”, where $a$ is one of the following:   “left”, to move to the adjacent train carriage in the clockwise direction,   “right”, to move to the adjacent train carriage in the counter-clockwise direction, or   “flip”, to toggle the light switch in the current train carriage.   After every step, the interactor replies with an integer $s$ ($s \\in \\{ 0,1\\} $), the state of the light switch in the train carriage that Hercule is currently in, after he has carried out the requested step. When you have determined the number of train carriages $n$, print one line of the form “! $n$” ($3 \\leq n \\leq 5000$), after which the interaction will stop. Printing the answer does not count as a query. The interactor is not adaptive; the initial state of the light switches is determined by the interactor before any interaction takes place. Make sure you flush the buffer after each write. Using more than $3n+500$ queries will result in a wrong answer verdict. A testing tool is provided to help you develop your solution.  .\n",

      "Here is the problem description: You are an archaeologist working at an excavation site where your team has found hundreds of clay tablets containing glyphs written in some ancient language. Not much is known about the language yet, but you know that there are only six different glyphs, each of them in the shape of a regular polygon with one vertex pointing to the right (see Figure 1(a) below). Only the boundary of each polygon is carved out of the clay.        (a) The six glyphs.        (b) The first sample input.        (c) Fitting triangles and hexagons to the first sample. The triangles’ score is higher.    Figure 1: Glyph recognition    You want to start analysing the language right away, so you need to get the text on the tablets into some machine readable format. Ideally, you would like to use an OCR (optical character recognition) tool for that, but you do not have one installed on your laptop and there is no internet connection at the site. Because of this you have devised your own scheme to digitise the ancient writings: for every glyph on a tablet you first find a number of sample points that are in the carved out region, i.e. on the boundary of the polygon. Based on those sample points you then calculate a score for each of the six glyphs and mark the one with the highest score as the recognised glyph. For a given number of corners $k$ ($3 \\le k \\le 8$), the score is computed as follows. Two regular $k$-gons are fitted to the sample points, one from the inside and one from the outside, such that the following hold:   Each polygon is centered at the origin, i.e. all vertices have equal distance to $(0,0)$.   Each polygon has a vertex on the positive $x$-axis.   The inner polygon is the largest such polygon containing none of the sample points.   The outer polygon is the smallest such polygon containing all of the sample points.   An example can be seen in Figure 1(c). The score for this value of $k$ is $\\frac{A_\\text {inner}}{A_\\text {outer}}$, where $A_\\text {inner}$ and $A_\\text {outer}$ are the areas of the inner and outer polygon, respectively. Given a set of sample points, find the glyph with the highest score..\n",

Your answer will be accepted if the absolute error does not exceed $10^{-6}$. If several values of $k$ result in a score that is within $10^{-6}$ of the optimal score, any one of them will be accepted.  \n",

      "Here is the problem description: Did you know that during the ACM-ICPC World Finals a big chessboard is installed every year and is available for the participants to play against each other? In this problem, we will test your basic chess-playing abilities to verify that you would not make a fool of yourself if you advance to the World Finals. Let us centrate on queens. As you probably know, the queens may move not only horizontally and vertically, but also diagonally. You are given a chessboard with $i-1$ queens already placed and your task is to find all squares that may be used to place the $i$-th queen such that it cannot be captured by any of the others..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The input consists of several tasks, at most $5$. Each task begins with a line containing three integer numbers separated by a space: $X, Y, N$. $X$ and $Y$ give the chessboard size, $1\\leq X, Y \\leq 20\\, 000$. $N = i-1$ is the number of queens already placed, $0\\leq N\\leq \\min (X\\cdot Y, 20\\, 000)$. After the first line, there are $N$ lines, each containing two numbers $x_ k, y_ k$ separated by a space. They give the position of the $k$-th queen, $1\\leq x_ k \\leq X, 1\\leq y_ k\\leq Y$. You may assume that those positions are distinct, i.e., no two queens share the same square. The last task is followed by a line containing three zeros..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Mole by Ahmad Kanbar, Unsplash  The mole family recently decided to dig a new tunnel network. The layout, which has already been decided, consists of chambers and bidirectional tunnels connecting them, forming a connected graph. Mother mole wants to use the opportunity to teach her two mole kids how to dig a tunnel network. As an initial quick demonstration, mother mole is going to start by digging out a few of the chambers and tunnels, in the form of a non-self-intersecting path in the planned tunnel network. She will then divide the remaining chambers between the two mole kids, making sure that each mole kid has to dig out the same number of chambers, or else one of the mole kids will become sad. (The tunnels are much easier to dig out, and thus of no concern.) The kids may work on their assigned chambers in any order they like. Since the mole kids do not have much experience with digging tunnel networks, mother mole realises one issue with her plan: if there is a tunnel between a pair of chambers that are assigned to different mole kids, there is a risk of an accident during the excavation of that tunnel if the other mole kid happens to be digging in the connecting chamber at the same time. Help mother mole decide which path to use for her initial demonstration, and how to divide the remaining chambers evenly, so that no tunnel connects a pair of chambers assigned to different mole kids. The initial path must consist of at least one chamber and must not visit a chamber more than once..\n",

The chambers are numbered from $1$ to $c$. There is at most one tunnel between any pair of chambers, and there exists a path in the network between any pair of chambers..\n",

Then output two more lines, each containing the $s$ chambers that the respective mole kid has to dig out, in any order. The input is chosen such that there exists at least one valid solution.

      "Here is the problem description: In the game of Rhombinoes, you have a board made up entirely of equilateral trianges (see the image), some of which are “live” and some are “dead”. Your goal is to place down as many rhombinoes (“rhombus”-shaped pieces) as possible on the board. Each rhombino should exactly cover two “adjacent” live triangles that have a common side, and no two rhombinoes can use the same triangle. Given the description of the live and dead triangles of a Rhombino board, what is the maximum number of rhombinoes you can simultaneously place down on the board? Each triangle in the board has a pair of coordinates $(x, y)$. The bottom-left triangle has coordinates $(0, 0)$ and will always be a triangle with its tip pointed upward. For any given triangle with coordinates $(x, y)$, the triangle adjacent to it on its right-side (if any) has coordinates $(x+1, y)$, and the triangle adjacent to it on its top-side (if any) has coordinates $(x, y+1)$. Left-side and bottom-side adjacency are defined similarly. Each board has a width $W$ and a height $H$. A board with width $W$ and height $H$ is the board which consists of all triangles with coordinates $(x, y)$ such that $0 \\leq x < W$ and $0 \\leq y < H$. For example, the game board in the image has width $6$ and height $3$. (See Figure 1 for clarification.)     Figure 1: Sample input, with cells $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(4,1)$, and $(3,0)$ dead.   .\n",

Exactly $K$ lines will follow. Each such line will contain a pair of space-separated integers $x$ and $y$ ($0 \\leq x < W$, $0 \\leq y < H$), indicating that the triangle with coordinates $(x,y)$ is a dead triangle.

Each slide can be viewed as an infinitely long, completely vertical spiral of radius $1$. When projected into the (flat) ground, the first slide has $(0, 0)$ as its centre point, and the second one has $(1, 0)$ as its centre point. Furthermore, the start of the slides are at $(1, 0)$ and $(2, 0)$ respectively, and then proceeds counter-clockwise around their respective centres. When Agneta rides her slide (the first one), she does so with vertical speed $1\\text { m/s}$, while Beatas slide has a bit higher gradient, so she goes with vertical speed $2\\text { m/s}$. However, their angular speeds around the centre is both equal to $1 \\text { rad/s}$. Since Beata is a little afraid of the slides, she always waits for Agneta to go first. $W$ seconds after Agneta went, Beata starts her descent. To make the infinite ride a bit more fun, the amusement park gives a prize if the two riders on the slides manage to pass a ball between them at some point. This prize consists of a lot of chocolate, which is Beata’s favourite treat. To maximize their chances of passing the ball successfully, they want to wait until their Euclidean distance is the smallest possible during the ride. How small will this distance be?.\n",

      "Here is the problem description: You are kayaking through a system of underground caves and suddenly realize that the tide is coming in and you are trapped! Luckily, you have a map of the cave system. You are stuck until the tide starts going out, so you will be here for a while. In the meantime, you want to determine the fastest way to the exit once the tide starts going out. The cave system is an $N$ by $M$ grid. Your map consists of two $N$ by $M$ grids of numbers: one that specifies the height of the ceiling in each grid square, and one that specifies the height of the floor in each grid square. The floor of the cave system is porous, which means that as the water level falls, no water will remain above the water level. You are trapped at the north-west corner of the map. The current water level is $H$ centimeters, and once it starts going down, it will drop at a constant rate of 10 centimeters per second, down to zero. The exit is at the south-east corner of the map. It is now covered by water, but it will become passable as soon as the water starts going down. At any time, you can move north, south, east or west to an adjacent square with the following constraints:   The water level, the floor height of your current square, and the floor height of the adjacent square must all be at least 50 centimeters lower than the ceiling height of the adjacent square. Note: this means that you will never be able to enter a square with less than 50 centimeters between the floor and the ceiling.   The floor height of the adjacent square must be at least 50 centimeters below the ceiling height of your current square as well.   You can never move off the edge of the map.   Note that you can go up or down as much as you want with your kayak. (You’re very athletic from all this kayaking!) For example, you can go from a square with floor at height 10 centimeters to an adjacent square with floor at height 9000 centimeters (assuming the constraints given above are met). These constraints are illustrated below:      In the first image, you can’t move to the right because the water level is less than 50 centimeters below the ceiling height of the adjacent square.   In the second image, you can’t move to the right because the floor height of your current square is less than 50 centimeters below the ceiling height of the adjacent square.   In the third image, you can’t move to the right because the floor height of the adjacent square is less than 50 centimeters below the ceiling height of the adjacent square. You’ll never be able to enter that square from any direction.   In the fourth image, you can’t move to the right because the floor height of the adjacent square is less than 50 centimeters below the ceiling height of the current square.   When moving from one square to another, if there are at least 20 centimeters of water remaining on the current square when you start moving from it, it takes 1 second to complete the move (you can use your kayak). Otherwise, it takes 10 seconds (you have to drag your kayak). Note that the time depends only on the water level in the square you are leaving, not in the square you are entering. It will be a while before the tide starts going out, and so you can spend as much time moving as you want before the water starts going down. What matters is how much time you will need from the moment the water starts going down until the moment you reach the exit. Can you calculate this time?.\n",
      "Here is the input description:   The first line will contain a single integer, T: the number of test cases   It is followed by T test cases, each starting with a line containing integers H, N and M, representing the initial water level height, in centimeters, and the map dimensions. The following 2N lines contain the ceiling and floor heights as follows:   The next N lines contain M space-separated integers each. The jth integer in the ith row represents Cij, the height of the ceiling in centimeters at grid location (j, i), where increasing i coordinates go South, and increasing j coordinates go East.   The next N lines contain M space-separated integers representing the heights of the floor, in the same format.     At the starting location, there will always be at least 50 cm of air between the ceiling and the starting water level, and at least 50 cm between the ceiling and the floor.   The exit location will always have at least 50 cm of air between the ceiling and the floor.   There will always be a way out (you got in, after all!).  .\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: t, where $x$ is the case number (starting from 1), and $t$ is the time, in seconds, starting from when the tide begins going out, that it takes you to make your way out of the cave system. Answers within an absolute or relative error of $10^{-6}$ of the correct answer will be accepted. Notes It is possible that you can go through the whole cave system before the tide starts dropping. In this case you will be able to wait at the exit for the tide to start dropping, so the answer in this case should be zero (this is the case in the fourth of the sample test cases). In the first sample test case, there are initially only 33 centimeters between the water level and the ceiling of the eastern square, so after the tide starts going down, you have to wait for at 1.7 seconds to enter it. Once it is accessible, you can start going in - but the water level in the western square is now so low (only 3 centimeters above the floor) that you have to drag your kayak for the next 10 seconds to get to the exit point. The initial situation in the second case is better - you have a lot of headroom in adjacent squares, so you can move, for example, to (1, 1) before the tide starts dropping. Once there, you have to wait for the tide to start going down, and the water level to go down to 90cm (that takes one second). Then you can kayak south and then east and get out (in a total of three seconds). Note that you cannot go through the cave at (2, 1), even though the ceiling there is high enough, because there is too little space between the floor of this cave and the ceiling of any caves you could try to enter from ((1, 1) and (2, 0)) - only 10 centimeters in each case. The third case is somewhat similar to the first - you have to wait at the starting position until the tide goes down to 50cm. After that you can kayak for the exit - but after three moves (taking three seconds) the water is at 20cm, which is only 10cm above the floor, which means the fourth move will be dragging instead of kayaking. In the fourth case you are really lucky! You can immediately go the exit, even before the tide starts leaving, and wait there.

      "Here is the problem description: Photo by rubyblossom   Two polar bears (of opposite genders) were floating around on ice floes (“isflak” in Swedish, “ľadová kryha” in Slovak) somewhere outside the northern parts of Greenland, and had finally decided to meet. After only a couple of minutes, and a few jumps between ice floes, the small ice floe one of the bears jumped to sank into the freezing water, along with the bear standing on it. Luckily, the bear survived, and eventually the two bears made a couple and got many small and cute polar bear cubs. Unlike polar bears, human scientists would probably not survive falling into the arctic waters, and they would have to compensate the lack of bear fur using intelligently written software to run on their PDAs, which can help them avoid stepping on smaller (and therefore more dangerous) ice floes than necessary. The scientists already have software and hardware to download high resolution up-to-date satellite photos of the area they will be in, and to transform the downloaded pictures into two dimensional polygons describing the shapes of the ice floes. You have been asked to write the software that given these descriptions, and the positions of the scientists, calculates the area of the smallest ice floe any of the scientists need to pass, including the ice floes the scientists are already standing on, so that they can meet. The scientists can only jump between two ice floes if they are closer to each other than some distance $d$. Actually, it is possible to jump between two floes if there exists one pair of points, one on each ice floe, on the surfaces or borders of the floes, that are not farther away from each other than the distance $d$. Even though the ice floes are floating around in the water, the relative positions of the ice floes can be considered constant during the time it takes for the scientists to meet. The ice floes are guaranteed to neither touch nor overlap each other..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The input starts with the number of test cases $N$ on a line by itself. For each test case the following information then follows: One line with the number of ice floes $(1 \\leq f \\leq 100)$ and the maximum distance $(0 < d \\leq 1\\, 000)$ that the scientists are able to jump. $d$ is a floating point number with maximum 4 decimals. After that, one line with the coordinates of the two scientists. The coordinates are given on the form $(x\\; y)$. Then follow $f$ lines with ice floe descriptions. An ice floe is described as a polygon. Every floe line consists of the number of vertices $(3 \\leq v \\leq 100)$ followed by $v$ coordinates, also on the form $(x\\; y)$. The coordinates might be given in clockwise or counterclockwise order. All coordinates in this problem are integers with absolute value at most $20\\, 000$..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: For each test case, output the surface area of the smallest ice floe any of the scientists need to pass in order for them to meet, provided that they have chosen the safest possible route. If no possible route exists, output “Scientists cannot meet”. The output for each test case should be on a line by itself. The output is considered correct if it is within relative or absolute error $10^{-7}$.     Figure 1: Illustration of the sample input     \n",

      "Here is the problem description: In ancient days, long before even LTH existed, there were $M$ pairs of lovers living along the Söderåsen ridge. Each of the $2M$ people lived at some integer distance in meters from the start of the ridge, and unfortunately, not in the same place as their partner. The shape of the ridge could be modeled as a list of positive integers $H$, the $i$th of which represents the height above sea level $i$ meters away from the start of the ridge. Walking one meter along the ridge would take the inhabitants as many minutes as the difference in height plus one (so moving from position $i$ to $i + 1$ would take $|H_ i - H_{i+1}| + 1$ minutes). The people living along Söderåsen eventually grew tired of walking for days on end in order to meet their loved ones, and so decided to build one bridge connecting two positions along the ridge. A bridge could have been built between indices $i$ and $j$ if $j > i$, $H_ i = H_ j$ and $H_ k < H_ i$ for every integer $k$ strictly between $i$ and $j$. Such a bridge would allow people to walk from position $i$ to $j$ in $|j - i|$ minutes. Unfortunately, the ancient Scanians did not have access to computers or courses in algorithm design, and so the bridge that was built may not have been the best one possible. The best bridge is one that makes the sum of the time it takes each pair to reach each other as small as possible. If the best possible bridge had been built, what would this sum have been?.\n",

The second line contains $N$ integers $H_1 \\dots H_ N$, where $0 \\leq H_ i \\leq 10^6$, representing the height of the ridge. Each of the next $M$ lines contain two integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$, where $a_ i, b_ i \\in \\{ 1, \\ldots , N \\} , a_ i \\neq b_ i$, the position along the ridge where the first and second person in pair $i$ lived.

      "Here is the problem description: Gunnar the priest received a mysterious message by post yesterday that said that one of his parishioners might be possessed. On the back it said ,,You are our only hope XORsist!\". Gunnar was in fact a sorcerer and had great experience in repelling spirits and demons. He decided to write down the names of everyone at his sermon and ended up with names numbered from $1$ to $N$. Later he realized that he took the XOR of all the numbers from $a$ to $b$ that would give him information on who’s possessed; if the number is $0$ no one is possessed and if it’s between $1$ and $N$ then it would be the person on the list corresponding to that number. If it’s larger than $N$ it must be Gunnar himself that’s possessed and then we’re all in trouble! Explanation of XOR XOR, usually denoted by $~ \\hat{}~ $ in programming languages, is an operation that takes two numbers and returns a new number. The operation is performed on the two numbers in binary , bit by bit. The following table shows how a new bit is calculated from the corresponding bits in the input numbers.     A   B   A XOR B     1   1   0     1   0   1     0   1   1     0   0   0     Let us take an example. The number $1337$ in binary is 10100111001 and the number $1993$ in binary is 11111001001.     1337   1   0   1   0   0   1   1   1   0   0   1     1993   1   1   1   1   1   0   0   1   0   0   1     1337 XOR 1993   0   1   0   1   1   1   1   0   0   0   0     The result is 01011110000 which is the number $752$..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line contains an integer $N$, the number of parishioners at Gunnar’s sermon. The next line contains two integers, $a$ and $b$, $1 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq N$..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: Print the number of the parishioner that’s possessed, Enginn if the value is $0$ and Gunnar if the value is greater than $N$. Explanation of Sample Inputs In the first sample $N = 3$, $a = 1$, $b = 3$. If we calculate the XOR of all values from $1$ to $3$ we get $(1\\textrm{ XOR }2)\\textrm{ XOR }3 = 0$. Thus no one is possessed so the answer is Enginn. In the second input $N = 7$, $a = 1$, $b = 4$. If we calculate the XOR of all numbers from $1$ to $4$ the result is $4$. Thus the fourth person on the list is possessed, so the answer is 4. In the third sample $N = 6$, $a = 3$, $b = 4$. If we calculate the XOR of all numbers from $3$ to $4$ the result is $7$. Gunnar is thus possessed and the answer is Gunnar. Scoring The solution will be tested on input data of varying difficulty and the data is divided into groups as shown in the table below. The solution will then be scored according to how many groups are solved.    Group   Points   Constraints     1   33   $ 1 \\le N \\le 1000$     2   33   $ 1 \\le N \\le 10^{18}$, $a = 1$     3   34   $ 1 \\le N \\le 10^{18}$     \n",

      "Here is the problem description: The ZOO management had been wondering for a long time how to increase the number of children visitors to the ZOO. The solution was surprising and unexpected in many ways. They installed a huge screen past the entrance and started to display short quizzes on it. The child in the crowd who first shouts out the answer to the quiz question is granted one day free access to the ZOO. The screen became soon very popular and various types of quizzes are routinely shown there. One type of the quiz is the math quiz containing arithmetic operations on integers. The management worries that older siblings and friends of the children might develop a math quiz screen hacking strategy: Snap the screen with the phone, run the image recognition SW which extracts formulas from the image, evaluates them, and presents the solution to the phone holder who immediately shouts out the answer. Your task is to assess the difficulty of producing the screen hacking software. To get a better feel of the problem you will first develop a simple toy model application. Your code will read the formula presented in the preprocessed form of ASCII art and evaluate it..\n",
      "Here is the input description: First line of each test case contains two integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \\leq R \\leq 3$, $1 \\leq C \\leq 1\\, 000$). Each of the following $R$ lines contains $C$ characters. The whole matrix of $R \\times C$ characters represents a single arithmetic formula written in ASCII art and generated by the following set of rules:  FORMULA -> COMPLEX | FORMULA + COMPLEX | FORMULA - COMPLEX  COMPLEX -> SQRT | FRACTION | TERM ______ SQRT -> \\/SIMPLE  SIMPLE FRACTION -> ====== SIMPLE  SIMPLE -> TERM | SIMPLE + TERM | SIMPLE - TERM  TERM -> INTEGER | INTEGER * TERM  INTEGER -> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | 999999 | 1000000  There are also a few additional specifications regarding the layout of the formula.   The horizontal bar of each SQRT is made of one or more underscore symbols (‘_’, ascii decimal code $95$) and it always occupies the uppermost line of the formula in the screen.   When the formula occupies exactly two lines, then the first line contains only horizontal bars of all SQRT parts of the formula.   When the formula occupies exactly three lines, then all TERMs and all arithmetic operation symbols which are not part of any FRACTION or SQRT occupy the second line of the formula in the screen.   The length of the horizontal bar of SQRT is the same as the length of SIMPLE under the bar.   The fraction bar in FRACTION consists of one or more equality signs, its length is equal to the maximum of the lengths of SIMPLE above the bar and SIMPLE below the bar.   There is always exactly one space preceding and following each arithmetic operation symbol (+, -, *) on a particular line.   The formula exactly fits in to the $R \\times C$ matrix, there are no blank/empty columns in front of the whole formula or behind it.   The whole formula is evaluated according to the standard arithmetic rules. Namely: Each FORMULA and each TERM is evaluated from left to right. Each SIMPLE is also evaluated from left to right with the additional standard condition that the multiplication has higher priority than the addition/subtraction. Evaluation of SQRT and FRACTION is also standard. The value of any evaluated FORMULA, COMPLEX, SQRT, FRACTION, SIMPLE and TERM is an integer whose absolute value does not exceed $1\\, 000\\, 000$..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Picture from Wikimedia Commons  The term “Harvard architecture” applies to a computer that has physically separate memories for instructions and data. The term originated with the Harvard Mark I computer, delivered by IBM in 1944, which used paper tape for instructions and relays for data.  Some modern microcontrollers use the Harvard architecture – but not paper tape and relays! Data memory is organized in banks, each containing the same number of data items. Each data-referencing instruction has a byte offset $f$ to a bank, and a bit $a$ that is used to select the bank to be referenced. If $a$ is $0$, then bank $0$ is referenced. If $a$ is $1$, then the value in a bank select register (BSR) identifies the bank to be used. Assume each instruction takes the same time to execute, and there is an instruction that can set the BSR’s value. For example, suppose there are $4$ banks of $8$ bytes each. To access location $5$, either use a single instruction with $a = 0$ and $f = 5$, or set the BSR to $0$ in one instruction and then use an instruction with $a = 1$ and $f = 5$. The first approach is faster since it does not require setting the BSR. Now suppose (with the same memory) the location to access is $20$. Only one approach will work here: execute an instruction that sets the BSR to $2$ (unless the BSR already has the value $2$) and then use an instruction with $a = 1$ and $f = 4$. A program is a sequence of operations. Each operation is either   a variable reference, written as V$i$, where $i$ is a positive integer, or   a repetition, written as R$n$ <program> E, where $n$ is a positive integer and <program> is an arbitrary program. This operation is equivalent to $n$ sequential occurrences of <program>.   Your problem is to determine the minimum running time of programs. In particular, given the number and size of the memory banks and a program to be executed, find the minimum number of instructions (which reference memory location and possibly set the BSR) that must be executed to run the program. To do this you must identify a mapping of variables to memory banks that yields the smallest execution time, and report that execution time – that is, the number of memory references and BSR register settings required. The BSR’s value is initially undefined, and changes only when an instruction explicitly sets its value. .\n",
      "Here is the input description: The input consists of a single test case. A test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers $b$ and $s$, where $1 \\le b \\le 13$ is the number of memory banks and $1 \\le s \\le 13$ is the number of variables that can be stored in each memory bank. The second line contains a non-empty program with at most $1\\, 000$ space-separated elements (each R$n$, V$i$, and E counts as one element). You may assume the following:   In a repetition R$n$, the number of repetitions satisfies $1 \\le n \\le 10^6$.   In a loop operation R$n$ <program> E, the loop body <program> is not empty.   In a variable reference V$i$, the variable index satisfies $1 \\le i \\le \\min (b \\cdot s, 13)$.   The total number of variable references performed by an execution of the program is at most $10^{12}$.  .\n",

They discovered two types of mutations. One type results in changing any single character of the sequence ($A \\rightarrow B$ or $B \\rightarrow A$). The second type changes a whole prefix of the sequence, specifically replacing all characters in positions from $1$ to $K$ (for some $K$ between $1$ and $N$, inclusive) with the other character ($A$ with $B$, $B$ with $A$).

Danny Ocean likes many things: casinos, elaborate heists, and complicated romantic relationships. But it’s a little-known fact that Danny loves binary strings most of all — binary strings of any length and composition. Recently, however, he has developed an unfortunate allergy to binary strings containing the substring 11. He is optimistic that there are still plenty of other binary strings for him to enjoy, but he’s not sure exactly how many, so he has hired you to write a program to find out..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: A staring contest is a classical battle of imperturbability in which two people stare into each other’s eyes while maintaining a facial expression of assured serenity. The goal is to maintain eye contact for longer than your opponent. The contest ends when one participant breaks composure, typically by looking away, smiling, speaking, or giggling. As a coach of the national staring contest you need to determine the imperturbability of each of your team’s $n$ members for the upcoming world finals. The $i$th athlete can maintain eye contact for exactly $a_ i$ seconds, but these values are unknown to you in the beginning. For instance, you could have a team of $n=3$ members:    $i$   Name   $a_ i$     1   Anna   431     2   Esther   623     3   Tony   121    When athletes $i$ and $j$ compete, the confrontation lasts exactly $\\min (a_ i, a_ j)$ seconds, at which moment the weaker contestant breaks composure and both contestants start smiling and giggling within a fraction of a second. For instance, if Anna competes against Esther, the contest lasts for $431$ seconds. Importantly, to an outside observer the actual winner of the confrontation (in this case, Esther) is impossible to determine, only the duration of the contest is measurable. Your goal is to estimate the values $a_1,\\ldots , a_ n$ using as few staring contests as possible. Clearly, the strength of the strongest athlete can never be determined, so you are allowed to underestimate one of the $a_ i$..\n",
      "Here is the input description: This is an interactive problem. The interaction begins with you reading a single line containing the integer $n$. You may then ask queries of the form “? $i$ $j$” such that $1\\leq i\\leq n$ and $1\\leq j\\leq n$ and $i\\neq j$. The response to a query is a single integer: the value $\\min (a_ i, a_ j)$. The interaction ends with you printing a single line consisting of ! followed by $n$ estimates in the form of integers $b_1$, $\\ldots $, $b_ n$, separated by spaces. This must be your final line of output. Your submission is correct if $b_ i=a_ i$ for every contestant $i$ except one, which you may underestimate. To be precise, we require $b_ i\\leq a_ i$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$ and allow $b_ k \\neq a_ k$ for at most one $k$. The interactor is non-adaptive, meaning that the $a_1,\\ldots , a_ n$ are determined before the interaction begins. Constraints and Scoring The number $n$ of athletes satisfies $2\\leq n\\leq 1500$. The imperturbability $a_ i$ of each athlete satisfies $1\\leq a_ i\\leq 86\\, 400$, they are all different. You can use at most $3000$ queries; your final line of output, i.e., the line starting with !, is not counted as a query. Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points. Each test group contains a set of test cases. To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group. Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission. For group $3$, your score is the minimum score among all test cases in the group. The score for each test case depends on the number of queries you use; fewer queries are better: Suppose you use $q$ queries. If $q \\le n+25$, then you get the full $80$ points. If $q > 3000$, then you get no points. Otherwise, you get $118.2 - 12 \\cdot \\ln (q - n)$ points, rounded to the nearest integer. For instance, for $n = 1500$ and $q = 3000$, you get $30$ points.

Note that Anna’s and Tony’s strengths are correctly determined. (Esther’s can never be determined.)  .\n",

He died in 1956, but, if he were alive today, he would probably appreciate some computational help in planning out his masterpieces. We start with a large, white canvas. We let drops of paint fall onto the canvas one after another, letting each one dry before the next. Thus, successive drops paint over the color left by previous drops. When a drop of paint hits the canvas at point $p$, it spreads out to form a circle of uniform thickness centered at $p$. A drop of volume $v$ will spread out to a circle of radius $r$ where $v = \\pi r^2$. Since underlying paint is already dry, all points a distance of $r$ or less from $p$ will be colored with the new drop’s color.

Alexa Forest’s map is a convex polygon $A$ with $N$ vertices on the Cartesian plane. $K$ sightings of Celery can be considered as $K$ points — all are strictly inside Alexa Forest. Bash is ready to search Alexa Forest to find Celery. However, Bash realized that Alexa Forest is simply too big. It would take decades to search the entire forest. But Bash is smart. Based on his research, Bash knows that Celery can only be found inside a polygon $Z$, where the vertices of $Z$ are a subset of $A$, and all $K$ sightings of Celery must be strictly inside polygon $Z$. Of course, there can be multiple polygons $Z$ satisfying the above conditions. Your task is to help Bash find the polygon $Z$ with smallest number of vertices.

      "Here is the problem description: MAPS 2020 included a problem named “Greedy Polygons” that described a dystopian world in which the greed that often characterizes human nature had spread to regular polygons, causing these normally well-behaved shapes to exhibit expansionistic tendencies. Now, as feared, this avarice has advanced further, infecting all convex polygons. In the past, the area of a convex polygon was fixed, but now, whenever it gets the chance, a convex polygon will carry out an expansion operation informally known as a “land grab.” A land grab with expansion distance $d > 0$ works as follows: every point outside the polygon that is at most distance $d$ from some point in the polygon is absorbed and becomes part of the enlarged polygon. (For our purposes, a polygon includes its interior, i.e., it is a solid shape.) Over time, a convex polygon might carry out many land grabs. (Technically, a convex polygon ceases to be a convex polygon (or any kind of polygon at all) after the first land grab, but, alas, such is the distorting effect of greed.) Given an initial convex polygon and an expansion distance $d$, what is the area of the resulting region after a specified number of land grabs? Figure $1$ depicts Sample Input $1$, which describes a $5$-sided convex polygon that carries out $2$ land grabs.     Figure 1: Illustration of Sample Input $1$   .\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line of input contains three space-separated integers, $n, d, g$, where $n$ is the number of convex polygon vertices $(3 \\leq n \\leq 60)$, $d$ is the expansion distance $(1 \\leq d \\leq 10)$, and $g$ is the number of land grabs $(0 \\leq g \\leq 20)$. This is followed by $n$ lines, each of which contains two space-separated integers, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of one of the polygon vertices. Each coordinate is in the interval $[-1\\, 000, 1\\, 000]$. The $n$ vertices are distinct, and are given in no particular order. It is guaranteed that no $3$ vertices are collinear..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: You are hired as a level designer for the next Pokémon series, with games called Ice and Fire. For the first of these two games, players have to get through a maze in an icy cave. The cave is represented as a grid, with each square of the grid being either ice, gravel or an obstacle. The player will start at a square, and then make a number of moves, each move represented by one of the four cardinal directions. The maze behaves in the following way. Assume that the square the player is trying to move into is an obstacle. In this case, the player does not move. If the square the player is moving into is gravel, the player successfully moves to the square and will stand still on the square. If the square is ice however, the player will first be transferred into that square, and then repeat the procedure again in the same direction. This means the player will glide on the ice until either colliding with an obstacle or reaching a square filled with gravel. Gliding on ice counts only as one move. You have almost finished your level design. In the maze, there is a goal square that you wish to reach. You still have to choose a square to be the starting point of the player. Since you do not want the level to be too easy, you want to make sure the number of moves needed to get from the starting point to the goal is sufficiently high. Can you compute the minimum number of moves needed to get from each point in the maze to the goal? Note that move may result in the player traveling multiple squares if gliding on the ice..\n",

Each square in the maze is represented by one of the following characters:   a period (.) represents a gravel square   a pound sign (#) represents an obstacle   an underscore (_) represents an ice square   an M (M) represents the goal in the maze, which is also covered in gravel   The edges of the maze are always surrounded by obstacle squares..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: In order to become the very best Pokenom trainer, Bash is studying Pokenom’s evolutions. Each Pokenom has a combat power ($CP$), indicating how strong the Pokenom is. After certain amount of training, a Pokenom can evolve, and the evolved Pokenom will have higher $CP$. A Pokenom can evolve multiple times. There is no known limit on how many times a Pokenom can evolve.    When a Pokenom evolves, his $CP$ always increases by a constant ratio. More formally, let’s $CP_ i$ denotes the $CP$ of the Pokenom after it evolved $i$ times. If the Pokenom evolves $k$ times, then the following conditions must be true:   $CP_0 < CP_1$ or $k < 1$,   $\\frac{CP_1}{CP_0} = \\frac{CP_2}{CP_1} = \\cdots = \\frac{CP_ k}{CP_{k-1}}$,   $CP_ i$ is a positive integer.   A sequence is called CP-sequence if it satisfies the above conditions. For example:   $1, 2, 4, 8, 16$ is a CP-sequence.   $4, 6, 9$ is a CP-sequence.   $4, 2, 1$ is NOT a CP-sequence, because $4 > 2$.   $4, 6, 9, 13.5$ is NOT a CP-sequence, because $13.5$ is not an integer.   $4, 6, 9, 13$ is NOT a CP-sequence, because $\\frac{13}{9} \\ne \\frac{9}{6}$.   Bash is very excited to learn about CP-sequences. Given an integer $S$, he wants to know how many CP-sequences there are whose sum equals $S$. For example, when $S = 7$, there are $5$ CP-sequences: $(7), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (1, 2, 4)$. When $S = 19$, there are $11$ sequences: $(19), (1, 18), (2, 17), \\ldots , (9, 10), (4, 6, 9)$..\n",

Unfortunately, New York being New York, the tickets are just a tiny bit expensive. But one of the shows has a ticket lottery each night where impecunious people such as yourself have a chance to win the right to buy slightly less expensive tickets to good seats.  The lottery operates as follows. First, everyone interested enters the lottery. Then, $n$ lucky winners are drawn, and each of these is offered to buy up to $t$ tickets. Given the number of people $p$ in your group (all of which entered the lottery) and the total number of people $m$ that entered the lottery, what is the probability that you will be able to get tickets for your entire group?

      "Here is the problem description: In order to keep up with the rapid technological advancements, Mr. Panda needs to backup all the data on his computer to allow him to do a full upgrade of his computer. Since the upgrade will take some time, he will peruse the services of the company ACM (Association of Computer Maintenance) that provides storage servers for him to temporarily store his data. Although ACM offers storage servers of any size, ACM wants to encourage more bulk purchases of servers of the same size as this saves cost. The cost of purchasing a set of storage servers that can each store $M$ bytes consists of a base cost of $M$ dollars plus $1$ dollar for every server of that size purchased. Mr. Panda wants to store a total of $K$ bytes of data and in order to easily track the servers, he wants to purchase a set of storage servers of the same size to store the $K$ bytes of data using the least cost. However, Mr. Panda feels compelled not to waste any space. Thus, he requires that the total storage space of the servers purchased must be exactly $K$ bytes. As storage space of technology increases exponentially with time, $K$ can be very large. You are given the prime factorization of $K$. Help Mr. Panda calculate the minimum cost required to store his data. As the minimum cost can be quite large, print the minimum cost modulo a prime number $10^9+7$..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The input consists of one line with a string of even length consisting of at most $700$ representing the prime factorization of $K$. Every pair of two consecutive digits, starting from the first two digits, represents one prime factor. So input of length $N$ will have $N/2$ prime factors. It is guaranteed that all the prime factors given are prime and that $K$ has at most $10^{10}$ divisors. Each prime factor will appear at most $100$ times..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: Output the minimum cost in one line as a single integer. Sample Data Explanation In the first example, $K = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 12$, so buy three servers with $M = 4$ bytes. Mr. Panda pays $4$ dollars base cost plus $3$ dollars for three servers purchased, or a total of $4+3 = 7$ dollars. Mr. Panda can also buy four servers with $M = 3$ bytes with the same cost of $7$ dollars. In the second example, $K = 13 \\cdot 11 = 143$, so buy eleven servers with $M = 13$ bytes. Mr. Panda pays $13$ dollars base cost plus $11$ dollars for eleven servers purchased, or a total $13+11 = 24$ dollars. Mr. Panda can also buy thirteen servers with $M = 11$ bytes with the same cost of $24$ dollars. In the third example, $K = 11$, so buy one server with $M = 11$ bytes. Mr. Panda pays $11$ dollars base cost plus $1$ dollar for one server purchased, or a total $11+1 = 12$ dollars. Note that although he can get a cheaper cost if he were able to purchase storage servers of different sizes, he cannot do so.  \n",

      "Here is the problem description: Hubtown is a large Nordic city which is home to $n$ citizens. Every morning, each of its citizens wants to travel to the central hub from which the city gets its name, by using one of the $m$ commuter trains which pass through the city. Each train line is a ray (i.e., a line segment which extends infinitely long in one direction), ending at the central hub, which is located at coordinates $(0, 0)$. However, the train lines have limited capacity (which may vary between train lines), so some train lines may become full, leading to citizens taking their cars instead of commuting. The city council wishes to minimize the number of people who go by car. In order to do this, they will issue instructions stating which citizens are allowed to take which train. A citizen will always take the train line which is of least angular distance from its house. However, if a citizen is exactly in the middle between two train lines, they are willing to take either of them, and city council can decide which of the two train lines the citizen should use. See Figure 1 for an example.     Figure 1: Illustration of Sample Input 1. The dashed arrows indicate which train lines the citizens are closest to (note that we are measuring angular distances, not Euclidean distance).    Your task is to help the council, by finding a maximum size subset of citizens who can go by train in the morning to the central hub, ensuring that each of the citizens take one of the lines they are closest to, while not exceeding the capacity of any train line. For this subset, you should also print what train they are to take..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $m$, where $0 \\le n \\le 200\\, 000$ is the number of citizens, and $1 \\le m \\le 200\\, 000$ is the number of train lines. The next $n$ lines each contain two integers $x$ and $y$, the Cartesian coordinates of a citizen’s home. No citizen lives at the central hub of the city. Then follow $m$ lines, each containing three integers $x$, $y$, and $c$ describing a train line, where $(x, y)$ are the coordinates of a single point (distinct from the central hub of the city) which the train line passes through and $0 \\le c \\le n$ is the capacity of the train line. The train line is the ray starting at $(0, 0)$ and passing through $(x, y)$. All coordinates $x$ and $y$ (both citizens’ homes and the points defining the train lines) are bounded by $1000$ in absolute value. No two train lines overlap, but multiple citizens may live at the same coordinates..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: First, output a single integer $s$ – the maximum number of citizens who can go by train. Then, output $s$ lines, one for each citizen that goes by train. On each line, output the index of the citizen followed by the index of the train line the citizen takes. The citizens are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$ in the order they are given in the input. The trains are numbered from $0$ to $m-1$ in the order they are given in the input. The output lines may be given in any order.  \n",

      "Here is the problem description: Image from https://pixabay.com/en/animal-cartoon-comic-dinosaur-1295637/.   The famous Jurassic park biologist Dean O’Saur has discovered new samples of what he expects to be the DNA of a dinosaur. With the help of his assistant Petra Dactil, he managed to sequence the samples, and now they are ready for analysis. Dean thinks this dinosaur was affected with a particular disease that mutated the DNA of some cells. To verify his theory, he needs to compute the most likely evolutionary tree from the samples, where the nodes are the samples of DNA. Because there is no temporal data for the DNA samples, he is not concerned where the root of the tree is. Dean considers the most likely evolutionary tree, the tree with smallest unlikeliness: the unlikeliness of a tree is defined as the sum of the weights of all edges, where the weight of an edge is the number of positions at which the two DNA strings are different. As a world expert in data trees, he asks you to reconstruct the most likely evolutionary tree. In the first sample, the optimal tree is AA - AT - TT - TC . The unlikeliness of the edge between AA and AT edge is $1$, because the strings AA and AT differ in exactly $1$ position. The weights of the other two edges are also $1$, so that the unlikeliness of the entire tree is $3$. Since there is no tree of unlikeliness less than $3$, the minimal unlikeliness of an evolutionary tree for this case is $3$..\n",

Each of the next $n$ lines contains a string of length $k$ consisting of the characters in ACTG.  .\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it:   On the first line, print the minimal unlikeliness of the evolutionary tree.   Then, print $n-1$ lines, each consisting of two integers $0\\leq u,v < n$, indicating that in the most likely evolutionary tree, there is an edge between DNA string $u$ and $v$. If there are multiple answers possible, any of them will be accepted.    \n",

      "- The outer loop runs `n` times where `n` is the length of the array. This ensures that all elements are sorted.\n",

Each entry in the list should specify the city from which the flight departs, the city at which the flight lands, and the price for the flight. The list should be sorted in increasing order by departure city, and if there is more than one flight departing from a city, then ties should be broken by the arrival city in increasing order.
