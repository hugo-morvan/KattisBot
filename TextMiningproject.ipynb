Unfortunately, it is also Frosh Week. Zac’s office window has a clear view of the stage where loud music is played. He cannot focus on any task when music is blaring. The event organizers are also very precise. They supply Zac with intervals of time when music will not be playing. These intervals are specified by their start and end times down to the millisecond. Each task that Zac completes must be completed in one quiet interval. He cannot pause working on a task when music plays (he loses his train of thought). Interstingly, the lengths of the tasks and quiet intervals are such that it is impossible to finish more than one task per quiet interval! Given a list of times $t_ i$ (in milliseconds) that each task will take and a list of times $\\\\ell _ j$ (in milliseconds) specifying the lengths of the intervals when no music is being played, what is the maximum number of tasks that Zac can complete?'\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Train. Unsplash License by Robin Ulrich on Unsplash  Hercule Poirot, world-renowned detective, was having a lovely cup of tea in his compartment on the Disorient Express when the train conductor rushed in. “We have lost track of the number of train carriages,” exclaimed the conductor. You see, this was no ordinary train, and had no first or last train carriage. Instead, the train carriages were connected to form a large cycle, causing the conductor’s confusion. Hercule thought for a moment. “That is most peculiar,” he said. “But I may be able to help you.” He reached over and grabbed the lamp from the side table. “You see, each train carriage has a light switch like this one. By moving between the carriages and toggling these switches, we can determine the number of train carriages.” The conductor was sceptical, but agreed to try it. “We are in a hurry,” he said, “so please determine $n$, the number of carriages that the train consists of, in at most $3n+500$ steps.” Here a step counts as either moving to an adjacent carriage or toggling a light switch in the current carriage. “The only thing I am certain of is that $n$ is at least $3$ and at most $5000$.”.\n",
      "Here is the input description: This is an interactive problem. Your submission will be run against an interactor, which reads the standard output of your submission and writes to the standard input of your submission. This interaction needs to follow a specific protocol: The interactor first sends an integer $s$ ($s \\in \\{ 0,1\\} $), the state of the light switch in Hercule’s initial carriage. Your submission may then send at most $3n+500$ steps1 for Hercule to carry out, each by printing one line of the form “? $a$”, where $a$ is one of the following:   “left”, to move to the adjacent train carriage in the clockwise direction,   “right”, to move to the adjacent train carriage in the counter-clockwise direction, or   “flip”, to toggle the light switch in the current train carriage.   After every step, the interactor replies with an integer $s$ ($s \\in \\{ 0,1\\} $), the state of the light switch in the train carriage that Hercule is currently in, after he has carried out the requested step. When you have determined the number of train carriages $n$, print one line of the form “! $n$” ($3 \\leq n \\leq 5000$), after which the interaction will stop. Printing the answer does not count as a query. The interactor is not adaptive; the initial state of the light switches is determined by the interactor before any interaction takes place. Make sure you flush the buffer after each write. Using more than $3n+500$ queries will result in a wrong answer verdict. A testing tool is provided to help you develop your solution.  .\n",

      "Here is the problem description: You are an archaeologist working at an excavation site where your team has found hundreds of clay tablets containing glyphs written in some ancient language. Not much is known about the language yet, but you know that there are only six different glyphs, each of them in the shape of a regular polygon with one vertex pointing to the right (see Figure 1(a) below). Only the boundary of each polygon is carved out of the clay.        (a) The six glyphs.        (b) The first sample input.        (c) Fitting triangles and hexagons to the first sample. The triangles’ score is higher.    Figure 1: Glyph recognition    You want to start analysing the language right away, so you need to get the text on the tablets into some machine readable format. Ideally, you would like to use an OCR (optical character recognition) tool for that, but you do not have one installed on your laptop and there is no internet connection at the site. Because of this you have devised your own scheme to digitise the ancient writings: for every glyph on a tablet you first find a number of sample points that are in the carved out region, i.e. on the boundary of the polygon. Based on those sample points you then calculate a score for each of the six glyphs and mark the one with the highest score as the recognised glyph. For a given number of corners $k$ ($3 \\le k \\le 8$), the score is computed as follows. Two regular $k$-gons are fitted to the sample points, one from the inside and one from the outside, such that the following hold:   Each polygon is centered at the origin, i.e. all vertices have equal distance to $(0,0)$.   Each polygon has a vertex on the positive $x$-axis.   The inner polygon is the largest such polygon containing none of the sample points.   The outer polygon is the smallest such polygon containing all of the sample points.   An example can be seen in Figure 1(c). The score for this value of $k$ is $\\frac{A_\\text {inner}}{A_\\text {outer}}$, where $A_\\text {inner}$ and $A_\\text {outer}$ are the areas of the inner and outer polygon, respectively. Given a set of sample points, find the glyph with the highest score..\n",

No sample point is at the origin and all points are distinct..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: Output the optimal number of corners $k$ ($3 \\le k \\le 8$), followed by the score obtained for that value of $k$. Your answer will be accepted if the absolute error does not exceed $10^{-6}$. If several values of $k$ result in a score that is within $10^{-6}$ of the optimal score, any one of them will be accepted.  \n"

As you probably know, the queens may move not only horizontally and vertically, but also diagonally.

After the first line, there are $N$ lines, each containing two numbers $x_ k, y_ k$ separated by a space. They give the position of the $k$-th queen, $1\\leq x_ k \\leq X, 1\\leq y_ k\\leq Y$.

The layout, which has already been decided, consists of chambers and bidirectional tunnels connecting them, forming a connected graph. Mother mole wants to use the opportunity to teach her two mole kids how to dig a tunnel network. As an initial quick demonstration, mother mole is going to start by digging out a few of the chambers and tunnels, in the form of a non-self-intersecting path in the planned tunnel network. She will then divide the remaining chambers between the two mole kids, making sure that each mole kid has to dig out the same number of chambers, or else one of the mole kids will become sad. (The tunnels are much easier to dig out, and thus of no concern.) The kids may work on their assigned chambers in any order they like. Since the mole kids do not have much experience with digging tunnel networks, mother mole realises one issue with her plan: if there is a tunnel between a pair of chambers that are assigned to different mole kids, there is a risk of an accident during the excavation of that tunnel if the other mole kid happens to be digging in the connecting chamber at the same time. Help mother mole decide which path to use for her initial demonstration, and how to divide the remaining chambers evenly, so that no tunnel connects a pair of chambers assigned to different mole kids. The initial path must consist of at least one chamber and must not visit a chamber more than once..\n",

Then output two more lines, each containing the $s$ chambers that the respective mole kid has to dig out, in any order. The input is chosen such that there exists at least one valid solution.

Your goal is to place down as many rhombinoes (“rhombus”-shaped pieces) as possible on the board. Each rhombino should exactly cover two “adjacent” live triangles that have a common side, and no two rhombinoes can use the same triangle. Given the description of the live and dead triangles of a Rhombino board, what is the maximum number of rhombinoes you can simultaneously place down on the board? Each triangle in the board has a pair of coordinates $(x, y)$. The bottom-left triangle has coordinates $(0, 0)$ and will always be a triangle with its tip pointed upward. For any given triangle with coordinates $(x, y)$, the triangle adjacent to it on its right-side (if any) has coordinates $(x+1, y)$, and the triangle adjacent to it on its top-side (if any) has coordinates $(x, y+1)$. Left-side and bottom-side adjacency are defined similarly. Each board has a width $W$ and a height $H$. A board with width $W$ and height $H$ is the board which consists of all triangles with coordinates $(x, y)$ such that $0 \\leq x < W$ and $0 \\leq y < H$. For example, the game board in the image has width $6$ and height $3$. (See Figure 1 for clarification.)     Figure 1: Sample input, with cells $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(4,1)$, and $(3,0)$ dead.   .\n",

Furthermore, the start of the slides are at $(1, 0)$ and $(2, 0)$ respectively, and then proceeds counter-clockwise around their respective centres. When Agneta rides her slide (the first one), she does so with vertical speed $1\\text { m/s}$, while Beatas slide has a bit higher gradient, so she goes with vertical speed $2\\text { m/s}$. However, their angular speeds around the centre is both equal to $1 \\text { rad/s}$. Since Beata is a little afraid of the slides, she always waits for Agneta to go first. $W$ seconds after Agneta went, Beata starts her descent. To make the infinite ride a bit more fun, the amusement park gives a prize if the two riders on the slides manage to pass a ball between them at some point. This prize consists of a lot of chocolate, which is Beata’s favourite treat.

      "To solve this problem, we need to determine the positions of Agneta and Beata as functions of time \\( t \\) and then calculate their Euclidean distance at each time step. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Position Calculation**:\n",
      "   - Agneta's position on her slide can be described by polar coordinates \\((r_A, \\theta_A)\\), where \\( r_A = 1 \\) (radius) and \\(\\theta_A = \\omega_A t\\) (angle), with \\(\\omega_A = 1 \\text{ rad/s}\\).\n",
      "   - Beata's position on her slide can be described by polar coordinates \\((r_B, \\theta_B)\\), where \\( r_B = 1 \\) (radius) and \\(\\theta_B = \\omega_B t\\), with \\(\\omega_B = 2 \\text{ rad/s}\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Convert Polar to Cartesian Coordinates**:\n",
      "   - For Agneta: \\( x_A = r_A \\cos(\\theta_A) = \\cos(\\theta_A) \\)\n",
      "   - For Beata: \\( x_B = r_B \\cos(\\theta_B) = \\cos(\\theta_B) \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Calculate Euclidean Distance**:\n",
      "   - The Euclidean distance \\( d(t) \\) between Agneta and Beata at time \\( t \\) is given by:\n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     d(t) = \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + y_B^2}\n",
      "     \\]\n",
      "   - Since \\( y_B = 0 \\) (Beata is on the ground), the distance simplifies to:\n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     d(t) = \\sqrt{(\\cos(\\theta_B) - \\cos(\\theta_A))^2}\n",
      "     \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Iterate Over Time**:\n",
      "   - We need to find the minimum distance between \\( t = 0 \\) and \\( t = W \\). We can do this by iterating over a range of times and calculating the distance at each step.\n",

      "Here is the problem description: You are kayaking through a system of underground caves and suddenly realize that the tide is coming in and you are trapped! Luckily, you have a map of the cave system. You are stuck until the tide starts going out, so you will be here for a while. In the meantime, you want to determine the fastest way to the exit once the tide starts going out. The cave system is an $N$ by $M$ grid. Your map consists of two $N$ by $M$ grids of numbers: one that specifies the height of the ceiling in each grid square, and one that specifies the height of the floor in each grid square. The floor of the cave system is porous, which means that as the water level falls, no water will remain above the water level. You are trapped at the north-west corner of the map. The current water level is $H$ centimeters, and once it starts going down, it will drop at a constant rate of 10 centimeters per second, down to zero. The exit is at the south-east corner of the map. It is now covered by water, but it will become passable as soon as the water starts going down. At any time, you can move north, south, east or west to an adjacent square with the following constraints:   The water level, the floor height of your current square, and the floor height of the adjacent square must all be at least 50 centimeters lower than the ceiling height of the adjacent square. Note: this means that you will never be able to enter a square with less than 50 centimeters between the floor and the ceiling.   The floor height of the adjacent square must be at least 50 centimeters below the ceiling height of your current square as well.   You can never move off the edge of the map.   Note that you can go up or down as much as you want with your kayak. (You’re very athletic from all this kayaking!) For example, you can go from a square with floor at height 10 centimeters to an adjacent square with floor at height 9000 centimeters (assuming the constraints given above are met). These constraints are illustrated below:      In the first image, you can’t move to the right because the water level is less than 50 centimeters below the ceiling height of the adjacent square.   In the second image, you can’t move to the right because the floor height of your current square is less than 50 centimeters below the ceiling height of the adjacent square.   In the third image, you can’t move to the right because the floor height of the adjacent square is less than 50 centimeters below the ceiling height of the adjacent square. You’ll never be able to enter that square from any direction.   In the fourth image, you can’t move to the right because the floor height of the adjacent square is less than 50 centimeters below the ceiling height of the current square.   When moving from one square to another, if there are at least 20 centimeters of water remaining on the current square when you start moving from it, it takes 1 second to complete the move (you can use your kayak). Otherwise, it takes 10 seconds (you have to drag your kayak). Note that the time depends only on the water level in the square you are leaving, not in the square you are entering. It will be a while before the tide starts going out, and so you can spend as much time moving as you want before the water starts going down. What matters is how much time you will need from the moment the water starts going down until the moment you reach the exit. Can you calculate this time?.\n",
      "Here is the input description:   The first line will contain a single integer, T: the number of test cases   It is followed by T test cases, each starting with a line containing integers H, N and M, representing the initial water level height, in centimeters, and the map dimensions. The following 2N lines contain the ceiling and floor heights as follows:   The next N lines contain M space-separated integers each. The jth integer in the ith row represents Cij, the height of the ceiling in centimeters at grid location (j, i), where increasing i coordinates go South, and increasing j coordinates go East.   The next N lines contain M space-separated integers representing the heights of the floor, in the same format.     At the starting location, there will always be at least 50 cm of air between the ceiling and the starting water level, and at least 50 cm between the ceiling and the floor.   The exit location will always have at least 50 cm of air between the ceiling and the floor.   There will always be a way out (you got in, after all!).  .\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: t, where $x$ is the case number (starting from 1), and $t$ is the time, in seconds, starting from when the tide begins going out, that it takes you to make your way out of the cave system. Answers within an absolute or relative error of $10^{-6}$ of the correct answer will be accepted. Notes It is possible that you can go through the whole cave system before the tide starts dropping. In this case you will be able to wait at the exit for the tide to start dropping, so the answer in this case should be zero (this is the case in the fourth of the sample test cases). In the first sample test case, there are initially only 33 centimeters between the water level and the ceiling of the eastern square, so after the tide starts going down, you have to wait for at 1.7 seconds to enter it. Once it is accessible, you can start going in - but the water level in the western square is now so low (only 3 centimeters above the floor) that you have to drag your kayak for the next 10 seconds to get to the exit point. The initial situation in the second case is better - you have a lot of headroom in adjacent squares, so you can move, for example, to (1, 1) before the tide starts dropping. Once there, you have to wait for the tide to start going down, and the water level to go down to 90cm (that takes one second). Then you can kayak south and then east and get out (in a total of three seconds). Note that you cannot go through the cave at (2, 1), even though the ceiling there is high enough, because there is too little space between the floor of this cave and the ceiling of any caves you could try to enter from ((1, 1) and (2, 0)) - only 10 centimeters in each case. The third case is somewhat similar to the first - you have to wait at the starting position until the tide goes down to 50cm. After that you can kayak for the exit - but after three moves (taking three seconds) the water is at 20cm, which is only 10cm above the floor, which means the fourth move will be dragging instead of kayaking. In the fourth case you are really lucky! You can immediately go the exit, even before the tide starts leaving, and wait there. Limits $1 \\leq T \\leq 50$. $1 \\leq N, M \\leq 100$. $1 \\leq H \\leq 10000$. $1 \\leq F_{xy} \\leq C_{xy} \\leq 10000$.  \n"

      "Here is the problem description: Photo by rubyblossom   Two polar bears (of opposite genders) were floating around on ice floes (“isflak” in Swedish, “ľadová kryha” in Slovak) somewhere outside the northern parts of Greenland, and had finally decided to meet. After only a couple of minutes, and a few jumps between ice floes, the small ice floe one of the bears jumped to sank into the freezing water, along with the bear standing on it. Luckily, the bear survived, and eventually the two bears made a couple and got many small and cute polar bear cubs. Unlike polar bears, human scientists would probably not survive falling into the arctic waters, and they would have to compensate the lack of bear fur using intelligently written software to run on their PDAs, which can help them avoid stepping on smaller (and therefore more dangerous) ice floes than necessary. The scientists already have software and hardware to download high resolution up-to-date satellite photos of the area they will be in, and to transform the downloaded pictures into two dimensional polygons describing the shapes of the ice floes. You have been asked to write the software that given these descriptions, and the positions of the scientists, calculates the area of the smallest ice floe any of the scientists need to pass, including the ice floes the scientists are already standing on, so that they can meet. The scientists can only jump between two ice floes if they are closer to each other than some distance $d$. Actually, it is possible to jump between two floes if there exists one pair of points, one on each ice floe, on the surfaces or borders of the floes, that are not farther away from each other than the distance $d$. Even though the ice floes are floating around in the water, the relative positions of the ice floes can be considered constant during the time it takes for the scientists to meet. The ice floes are guaranteed to neither touch nor overlap each other..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The input starts with the number of test cases $N$ on a line by itself. For each test case the following information then follows: One line with the number of ice floes $(1 \\leq f \\leq 100)$ and the maximum distance $(0 < d \\leq 1\\, 000)$ that the scientists are able to jump. $d$ is a floating point number with maximum 4 decimals. After that, one line with the coordinates of the two scientists. The coordinates are given on the form $(x\\; y)$. Then follow $f$ lines with ice floe descriptions. An ice floe is described as a polygon. Every floe line consists of the number of vertices $(3 \\leq v \\leq 100)$ followed by $v$ coordinates, also on the form $(x\\; y)$. The coordinates might be given in clockwise or counterclockwise order. All coordinates in this problem are integers with absolute value at most $20\\, 000$..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: For each test case, output the surface area of the smallest ice floe any of the scientists need to pass in order for them to meet, provided that they have chosen the safest possible route. If no possible route exists, output “Scientists cannot meet”. The output for each test case should be on a line by itself. The output is considered correct if it is within relative or absolute error $10^{-7}$.     Figure 1: Illustration of the sample input     \n"

      "Here is the problem description: In ancient days, long before even LTH existed, there were $M$ pairs of lovers living along the Söderåsen ridge. Each of the $2M$ people lived at some integer distance in meters from the start of the ridge, and unfortunately, not in the same place as their partner. The shape of the ridge could be modeled as a list of positive integers $H$, the $i$th of which represents the height above sea level $i$ meters away from the start of the ridge. Walking one meter along the ridge would take the inhabitants as many minutes as the difference in height plus one (so moving from position $i$ to $i + 1$ would take $|H_ i - H_{i+1}| + 1$ minutes). The people living along Söderåsen eventually grew tired of walking for days on end in order to meet their loved ones, and so decided to build one bridge connecting two positions along the ridge. A bridge could have been built between indices $i$ and $j$ if $j > i$, $H_ i = H_ j$ and $H_ k < H_ i$ for every integer $k$ strictly between $i$ and $j$. Such a bridge would allow people to walk from position $i$ to $j$ in $|j - i|$ minutes. Unfortunately, the ancient Scanians did not have access to computers or courses in algorithm design, and so the bridge that was built may not have been the best one possible. The best bridge is one that makes the sum of the time it takes each pair to reach each other as small as possible. If the best possible bridge had been built, what would this sum have been?.\n",

The second line contains $N$ integers $H_1 \\dots H_ N$, where $0 \\leq H_ i \\leq 10^6$, representing the height of the ridge. Each of the next $M$ lines contain two integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$, where $a_ i, b_ i \\in \\{ 1, \\ldots , N \\} , a_ i \\neq b_ i$, the position along the ridge where the first and second person in pair $i$ lived.

Explanation of XOR XOR, usually denoted by $~ \\hat{}~ $ in programming languages, is an operation that takes two numbers and returns a new number. The operation is performed on the two numbers in binary , bit by bit. The following table shows how a new bit is calculated from the corresponding bits in the input numbers.     A   B   A XOR B     1   1   0     1   0   1     0   1   1     0   0   0     Let us take an example. The number $1337$ in binary is 10100111001 and the number $1993$ in binary is 11111001001.     1337   1   0   1   0   0   1   1   1   0   0   1     1993   1   1   1   1   1   0   0   1   0   0   1     1337 XOR 1993   0   1   0   1   1   1   1   0   0   0   0     The result is 01011110000 which is the number $752$..\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line contains an integer $N$, the number of parishioners at Gunnar’s sermon. The next line contains two integers, $a$ and $b$, $1 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq N$..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: Print the number of the parishioner that’s possessed, Enginn if the value is $0$ and Gunnar if the value is greater than $N$. Explanation of Sample Inputs In the first sample $N = 3$, $a = 1$, $b = 3$. If we calculate the XOR of all values from $1$ to $3$ we get $(1\\textrm{ XOR }2)\\textrm{ XOR }3 = 0$. Thus no one is possessed so the answer is Enginn. In the second input $N = 7$, $a = 1$, $b = 4$. If we calculate the XOR of all numbers from $1$ to $4$ the result is $4$. Thus the fourth person on the list is possessed, so the answer is 4. In the third sample $N = 6$, $a = 3$, $b = 4$. If we calculate the XOR of all numbers from $3$ to $4$ the result is $7$. Gunnar is thus possessed and the answer is Gunnar. Scoring The solution will be tested on input data of varying difficulty and the data is divided into groups as shown in the table below. The solution will then be scored according to how many groups are solved.

The solution was surprising and unexpected in many ways. They installed a huge screen past the entrance and started to display short quizzes on it. The child in the crowd who first shouts out the answer to the quiz question is granted one day free access to the ZOO. The screen became soon very popular and various types of quizzes are routinely shown there. One type of the quiz is the math quiz containing arithmetic operations on integers. The management worries that older siblings and friends of the children might develop a math quiz screen hacking strategy: Snap the screen with the phone, run the image recognition SW which extracts formulas from the image, evaluates them, and presents the solution to the phone holder who immediately shouts out the answer. Your task is to assess the difficulty of producing the screen hacking software. To get a better feel of the problem you will first develop a simple toy model application.

      "Here is the input description: First line of each test case contains two integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \\leq R \\leq 3$, $1 \\leq C \\leq 1\\, 000$). Each of the following $R$ lines contains $C$ characters. The whole matrix of $R \\times C$ characters represents a single arithmetic formula written in ASCII art and generated by the following set of rules:  FORMULA -> COMPLEX | FORMULA + COMPLEX | FORMULA - COMPLEX  COMPLEX -> SQRT | FRACTION | TERM ______ SQRT -> \\/SIMPLE  SIMPLE FRACTION -> ====== SIMPLE  SIMPLE -> TERM | SIMPLE + TERM | SIMPLE - TERM  TERM -> INTEGER | INTEGER * TERM  INTEGER -> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | 999999 | 1000000  There are also a few additional specifications regarding the layout of the formula.   The horizontal bar of each SQRT is made of one or more underscore symbols (‘_’, ascii decimal code $95$) and it always occupies the uppermost line of the formula in the screen.   When the formula occupies exactly two lines, then the first line contains only horizontal bars of all SQRT parts of the formula.   When the formula occupies exactly three lines, then all TERMs and all arithmetic operation symbols which are not part of any FRACTION or SQRT occupy the second line of the formula in the screen.   The length of the horizontal bar of SQRT is the same as the length of SIMPLE under the bar.   The fraction bar in FRACTION consists of one or more equality signs, its length is equal to the maximum of the lengths of SIMPLE above the bar and SIMPLE below the bar.   There is always exactly one space preceding and following each arithmetic operation symbol (+, -, *) on a particular line.   The formula exactly fits in to the $R \\times C$ matrix, there are no blank/empty columns in front of the whole formula or behind it.   The whole formula is evaluated according to the standard arithmetic rules. Namely: Each FORMULA and each TERM is evaluated from left to right. Each SIMPLE is also evaluated from left to right with the additional standard condition that the multiplication has higher priority than the addition/subtraction. Evaluation of SQRT and FRACTION is also standard. The value of any evaluated FORMULA, COMPLEX, SQRT, FRACTION, SIMPLE and TERM is an integer whose absolute value does not exceed $1\\, 000\\, 000$..\n",

      "Here is the problem description: Picture from Wikimedia Commons  The term “Harvard architecture” applies to a computer that has physically separate memories for instructions and data. The term originated with the Harvard Mark I computer, delivered by IBM in 1944, which used paper tape for instructions and relays for data.  Some modern microcontrollers use the Harvard architecture – but not paper tape and relays! Data memory is organized in banks, each containing the same number of data items. Each data-referencing instruction has a byte offset $f$ to a bank, and a bit $a$ that is used to select the bank to be referenced. If $a$ is $0$, then bank $0$ is referenced. If $a$ is $1$, then the value in a bank select register (BSR) identifies the bank to be used. Assume each instruction takes the same time to execute, and there is an instruction that can set the BSR’s value. For example, suppose there are $4$ banks of $8$ bytes each. To access location $5$, either use a single instruction with $a = 0$ and $f = 5$, or set the BSR to $0$ in one instruction and then use an instruction with $a = 1$ and $f = 5$. The first approach is faster since it does not require setting the BSR. Now suppose (with the same memory) the location to access is $20$. Only one approach will work here: execute an instruction that sets the BSR to $2$ (unless the BSR already has the value $2$) and then use an instruction with $a = 1$ and $f = 4$. A program is a sequence of operations. Each operation is either   a variable reference, written as V$i$, where $i$ is a positive integer, or   a repetition, written as R$n$ <program> E, where $n$ is a positive integer and <program> is an arbitrary program. This operation is equivalent to $n$ sequential occurrences of <program>.   Your problem is to determine the minimum running time of programs. In particular, given the number and size of the memory banks and a program to be executed, find the minimum number of instructions (which reference memory location and possibly set the BSR) that must be executed to run the program. To do this you must identify a mapping of variables to memory banks that yields the smallest execution time, and report that execution time – that is, the number of memory references and BSR register settings required. The BSR’s value is initially undefined, and changes only when an instruction explicitly sets its value. .\n",
      "Here is the input description: The input consists of a single test case. A test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers $b$ and $s$, where $1 \\le b \\le 13$ is the number of memory banks and $1 \\le s \\le 13$ is the number of variables that can be stored in each memory bank. The second line contains a non-empty program with at most $1\\, 000$ space-separated elements (each R$n$, V$i$, and E counts as one element). You may assume the following:   In a repetition R$n$, the number of repetitions satisfies $1 \\le n \\le 10^6$.   In a loop operation R$n$ <program> E, the loop body <program> is not empty.   In a variable reference V$i$, the variable index satisfies $1 \\le i \\le \\min (b \\cdot s, 13)$.   The total number of variable references performed by an execution of the program is at most $10^{12}$.  .\n",

The second type changes a whole prefix of the sequence, specifically replacing all characters in positions from $1$ to $K$ (for some $K$ between $1$ and $N$, inclusive) with the other character ($A$ with $B$, $B$ with $A$).

This is because the last character of a valid string of length \\( i \\) can be '0' (and the previous character can be either '0' or '1') or '1' (and the previous character must be '0').\n",

      "Here is the problem description: A staring contest is a classical battle of imperturbability in which two people stare into each other’s eyes while maintaining a facial expression of assured serenity. The goal is to maintain eye contact for longer than your opponent. The contest ends when one participant breaks composure, typically by looking away, smiling, speaking, or giggling. As a coach of the national staring contest you need to determine the imperturbability of each of your team’s $n$ members for the upcoming world finals. The $i$th athlete can maintain eye contact for exactly $a_ i$ seconds, but these values are unknown to you in the beginning. For instance, you could have a team of $n=3$ members:    $i$   Name   $a_ i$     1   Anna   431     2   Esther   623     3   Tony   121    When athletes $i$ and $j$ compete, the confrontation lasts exactly $\\min (a_ i, a_ j)$ seconds, at which moment the weaker contestant breaks composure and both contestants start smiling and giggling within a fraction of a second. For instance, if Anna competes against Esther, the contest lasts for $431$ seconds. Importantly, to an outside observer the actual winner of the confrontation (in this case, Esther) is impossible to determine, only the duration of the contest is measurable. Your goal is to estimate the values $a_1,\\ldots , a_ n$ using as few staring contests as possible. Clearly, the strength of the strongest athlete can never be determined, so you are allowed to underestimate one of the $a_ i$..\n",
      "Here is the input description: This is an interactive problem. The interaction begins with you reading a single line containing the integer $n$. You may then ask queries of the form “? $i$ $j$” such that $1\\leq i\\leq n$ and $1\\leq j\\leq n$ and $i\\neq j$. The response to a query is a single integer: the value $\\min (a_ i, a_ j)$. The interaction ends with you printing a single line consisting of ! followed by $n$ estimates in the form of integers $b_1$, $\\ldots $, $b_ n$, separated by spaces. This must be your final line of output. Your submission is correct if $b_ i=a_ i$ for every contestant $i$ except one, which you may underestimate. To be precise, we require $b_ i\\leq a_ i$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$ and allow $b_ k \\neq a_ k$ for at most one $k$. The interactor is non-adaptive, meaning that the $a_1,\\ldots , a_ n$ are determined before the interaction begins. Constraints and Scoring The number $n$ of athletes satisfies $2\\leq n\\leq 1500$. The imperturbability $a_ i$ of each athlete satisfies $1\\leq a_ i\\leq 86\\, 400$, they are all different. You can use at most $3000$ queries; your final line of output, i.e., the line starting with !, is not counted as a query. Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points. Each test group contains a set of test cases. To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group. Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission. For group $3$, your score is the minimum score among all test cases in the group. The score for each test case depends on the number of queries you use; fewer queries are better: Suppose you use $q$ queries. If $q \\le n+25$, then you get the full $80$ points. If $q > 3000$, then you get no points. Otherwise, you get $118.2 - 12 \\cdot \\ln (q - n)$ points, rounded to the nearest integer. For instance, for $n = 1500$ and $q = 3000$, you get $30$ points.

We let drops of paint fall onto the canvas one after another, letting each one dry before the next. Thus, successive drops paint over the color left by previous drops. When a drop of paint hits the canvas at point $p$, it spreads out to form a circle of uniform thickness centered at $p$. A drop of volume $v$ will spread out to a circle of radius $r$ where $v = \\pi r^2$. Since underlying paint is already dry, all points a distance of $r$ or less from $p$ will be colored with the new drop’s color.

      "Here is the problem description: Celery — the legendary Pokenom has been spotted in Alexa Forest. To become the best Pokenom trainer, Bash has arrived at Alexa Forest to capture Celery. After lots of information gathering, Bash was able to draw a map of Alexa Forest, and noted down $K$ sightings of Celery. Alexa Forest’s map is a convex polygon $A$ with $N$ vertices on the Cartesian plane. $K$ sightings of Celery can be considered as $K$ points — all are strictly inside Alexa Forest. Bash is ready to search Alexa Forest to find Celery. However, Bash realized that Alexa Forest is simply too big. It would take decades to search the entire forest. But Bash is smart. Based on his research, Bash knows that Celery can only be found inside a polygon $Z$, where the vertices of $Z$ are a subset of $A$, and all $K$ sightings of Celery must be strictly inside polygon $Z$. Of course, there can be multiple polygons $Z$ satisfying the above conditions. Your task is to help Bash find the polygon $Z$ with smallest number of vertices. Note A point $P$ is strictly inside Polygon $A$, iff $P$ is inside $A$ and $P$ does not lie on the border of $A$..\n",

The vertices are listed in either clockwise or counterclockwise order. It is guaranteed that Alexa Forest is convex.   The next line contains a single positive integer $K$ $(1 \\le K \\le 10^5)$.   The next $K$ lines, each line contains $2$ integers $x_ i$, $y_ i$ — the coordinates of a sighting of Celery $(-10^9 \\le x_ i, y_ i \\le 10^9)$.

This problem can be approached using the concept of the Convex Hull, which is a well-known algorithm for finding the smallest convex polygon that encloses a set of points.\n",

      "Here is the problem description: MAPS 2020 included a problem named “Greedy Polygons” that described a dystopian world in which the greed that often characterizes human nature had spread to regular polygons, causing these normally well-behaved shapes to exhibit expansionistic tendencies. Now, as feared, this avarice has advanced further, infecting all convex polygons. In the past, the area of a convex polygon was fixed, but now, whenever it gets the chance, a convex polygon will carry out an expansion operation informally known as a “land grab.” A land grab with expansion distance $d > 0$ works as follows: every point outside the polygon that is at most distance $d$ from some point in the polygon is absorbed and becomes part of the enlarged polygon. (For our purposes, a polygon includes its interior, i.e., it is a solid shape.) Over time, a convex polygon might carry out many land grabs. (Technically, a convex polygon ceases to be a convex polygon (or any kind of polygon at all) after the first land grab, but, alas, such is the distorting effect of greed.) Given an initial convex polygon and an expansion distance $d$, what is the area of the resulting region after a specified number of land grabs? Figure $1$ depicts Sample Input $1$, which describes a $5$-sided convex polygon that carries out $2$ land grabs.     Figure 1: Illustration of Sample Input $1$   .\n",
      "Here is the input description: The first line of input contains three space-separated integers, $n, d, g$, where $n$ is the number of convex polygon vertices $(3 \\leq n \\leq 60)$, $d$ is the expansion distance $(1 \\leq d \\leq 10)$, and $g$ is the number of land grabs $(0 \\leq g \\leq 20)$. This is followed by $n$ lines, each of which contains two space-separated integers, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of one of the polygon vertices. Each coordinate is in the interval $[-1\\, 000, 1\\, 000]$. The $n$ vertices are distinct, and are given in no particular order. It is guaranteed that no $3$ vertices are collinear..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: Output the area of the region occupied by the convex polygon after $g$ land grabs. Your answer will be considered correct if it is within $10^{-3}$ of the official answer.  \n"

      "Here is the problem description: You are hired as a level designer for the next Pokémon series, with games called Ice and Fire. For the first of these two games, players have to get through a maze in an icy cave. The cave is represented as a grid, with each square of the grid being either ice, gravel or an obstacle. The player will start at a square, and then make a number of moves, each move represented by one of the four cardinal directions. The maze behaves in the following way. Assume that the square the player is trying to move into is an obstacle. In this case, the player does not move. If the square the player is moving into is gravel, the player successfully moves to the square and will stand still on the square. If the square is ice however, the player will first be transferred into that square, and then repeat the procedure again in the same direction. This means the player will glide on the ice until either colliding with an obstacle or reaching a square filled with gravel. Gliding on ice counts only as one move. You have almost finished your level design. In the maze, there is a goal square that you wish to reach. You still have to choose a square to be the starting point of the player. Since you do not want the level to be too easy, you want to make sure the number of moves needed to get from the starting point to the goal is sufficiently high. Can you compute the minimum number of moves needed to get from each point in the maze to the goal? Note that move may result in the player traveling multiple squares if gliding on the ice..\n",

The next $R$ lines contains $C$ characters each, describing the maze. Each square in the maze is represented by one of the following characters:   a period (.) represents a gravel square   a pound sign (#) represents an obstacle   an underscore (_) represents an ice square   an M (M) represents the goal in the maze, which is also covered in gravel   The edges of the maze are always surrounded by obstacle squares..\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it: Output $R$ lines with $C$ integers each, one for each square, containing the number of moves needed to reach the goal. If it is not possible to reach the target from a square, output $-1$ instead for that square.  \n"

      "Here is the problem description: In order to become the very best Pokenom trainer, Bash is studying Pokenom’s evolutions. Each Pokenom has a combat power ($CP$), indicating how strong the Pokenom is. After certain amount of training, a Pokenom can evolve, and the evolved Pokenom will have higher $CP$. A Pokenom can evolve multiple times. There is no known limit on how many times a Pokenom can evolve.    When a Pokenom evolves, his $CP$ always increases by a constant ratio. More formally, let’s $CP_ i$ denotes the $CP$ of the Pokenom after it evolved $i$ times. If the Pokenom evolves $k$ times, then the following conditions must be true:   $CP_0 < CP_1$ or $k < 1$,   $\\frac{CP_1}{CP_0} = \\frac{CP_2}{CP_1} = \\cdots = \\frac{CP_ k}{CP_{k-1}}$,   $CP_ i$ is a positive integer.   A sequence is called CP-sequence if it satisfies the above conditions. For example:   $1, 2, 4, 8, 16$ is a CP-sequence.   $4, 6, 9$ is a CP-sequence.   $4, 2, 1$ is NOT a CP-sequence, because $4 > 2$.   $4, 6, 9, 13.5$ is NOT a CP-sequence, because $13.5$ is not an integer.   $4, 6, 9, 13$ is NOT a CP-sequence, because $\\frac{13}{9} \\ne \\frac{9}{6}$.   Bash is very excited to learn about CP-sequences. Given an integer $S$, he wants to know how many CP-sequences there are whose sum equals $S$. For example, when $S = 7$, there are $5$ CP-sequences: $(7), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (1, 2, 4)$. When $S = 19$, there are $11$ sequences: $(19), (1, 18), (2, 17), \\ldots , (9, 10), (4, 6, 9)$..\n",

Since the upgrade will take some time, he will peruse the services of the company ACM (Association of Computer Maintenance) that provides storage servers for him to temporarily store his data. Although ACM offers storage servers of any size, ACM wants to encourage more bulk purchases of servers of the same size as this saves cost. The cost of purchasing a set of storage servers that can each store $M$ bytes consists of a base cost of $M$ dollars plus $1$ dollar for every server of that size purchased. Mr. Panda wants to store a total of $K$ bytes of data and in order to easily track the servers, he wants to purchase a set of storage servers of the same size to store the $K$ bytes of data using the least cost. However, Mr. Panda feels compelled not to waste any space. Thus, he requires that the total storage space of the servers purchased must be exactly $K$ bytes. As storage space of technology increases exponentially with time, $K$ can be very large. You are given the prime factorization of $K$. Help Mr. Panda calculate the minimum cost required to store his data. As the minimum cost can be quite large, print the minimum cost modulo a prime number $10^9+7$..\n",

Mr. Panda pays $4$ dollars base cost plus $3$ dollars for three servers purchased, or a total of $4+3 = 7$ dollars. Mr. Panda can also buy four servers with $M = 3$ bytes with the same cost of $7$ dollars. In the second example, $K = 13 \\cdot 11 = 143$, so buy eleven servers with $M = 13$ bytes. Mr. Panda pays $13$ dollars base cost plus $11$ dollars for eleven servers purchased, or a total $13+11 = 24$ dollars. Mr. Panda can also buy thirteen servers with $M = 11$ bytes with the same cost of $24$ dollars. In the third example, $K = 11$, so buy one server with $M = 11$ bytes. Mr. Panda pays $11$ dollars base cost plus $1$ dollar for one server purchased, or a total $11+1 = 12$ dollars.

      "Here is the problem description: Hubtown is a large Nordic city which is home to $n$ citizens. Every morning, each of its citizens wants to travel to the central hub from which the city gets its name, by using one of the $m$ commuter trains which pass through the city. Each train line is a ray (i.e., a line segment which extends infinitely long in one direction), ending at the central hub, which is located at coordinates $(0, 0)$. However, the train lines have limited capacity (which may vary between train lines), so some train lines may become full, leading to citizens taking their cars instead of commuting. The city council wishes to minimize the number of people who go by car. In order to do this, they will issue instructions stating which citizens are allowed to take which train. A citizen will always take the train line which is of least angular distance from its house. However, if a citizen is exactly in the middle between two train lines, they are willing to take either of them, and city council can decide which of the two train lines the citizen should use. See Figure 1 for an example.     Figure 1: Illustration of Sample Input 1. The dashed arrows indicate which train lines the citizens are closest to (note that we are measuring angular distances, not Euclidean distance).    Your task is to help the council, by finding a maximum size subset of citizens who can go by train in the morning to the central hub, ensuring that each of the citizens take one of the lines they are closest to, while not exceeding the capacity of any train line. For this subset, you should also print what train they are to take..\n",

The next $n$ lines each contain two integers $x$ and $y$, the Cartesian coordinates of a citizen’s home. No citizen lives at the central hub of the city. Then follow $m$ lines, each containing three integers $x$, $y$, and $c$ describing a train line, where $(x, y)$ are the coordinates of a single point (distinct from the central hub of the city) which the train line passes through and $0 \\le c \\le n$ is the capacity of the train line. The train line is the ray starting at $(0, 0)$ and passing through $(x, y)$. All coordinates $x$ and $y$ (both citizens’ homes and the points defining the train lines) are bounded by $1000$ in absolute value. No two train lines overlap, but multiple citizens may live at the same coordinates..\n",

Then, output $s$ lines, one for each citizen that goes by train. On each line, output the index of the citizen followed by the index of the train line the citizen takes. The citizens are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$ in the order they are given in the input. The trains are numbered from $0$ to $m-1$ in the order they are given in the input.

      "Here is the problem description: Image from https://pixabay.com/en/animal-cartoon-comic-dinosaur-1295637/.   The famous Jurassic park biologist Dean O’Saur has discovered new samples of what he expects to be the DNA of a dinosaur. With the help of his assistant Petra Dactil, he managed to sequence the samples, and now they are ready for analysis. Dean thinks this dinosaur was affected with a particular disease that mutated the DNA of some cells. To verify his theory, he needs to compute the most likely evolutionary tree from the samples, where the nodes are the samples of DNA. Because there is no temporal data for the DNA samples, he is not concerned where the root of the tree is. Dean considers the most likely evolutionary tree, the tree with smallest unlikeliness: the unlikeliness of a tree is defined as the sum of the weights of all edges, where the weight of an edge is the number of positions at which the two DNA strings are different. As a world expert in data trees, he asks you to reconstruct the most likely evolutionary tree. In the first sample, the optimal tree is AA - AT - TT - TC . The unlikeliness of the edge between AA and AT edge is $1$, because the strings AA and AT differ in exactly $1$ position. The weights of the other two edges are also $1$, so that the unlikeliness of the entire tree is $3$. Since there is no tree of unlikeliness less than $3$, the minimal unlikeliness of an evolutionary tree for this case is $3$..\n",

Each of the next $n$ lines contains a string of length $k$ consisting of the characters in ACTG.  .\n",
      "Here is the required output format, make sure you match it:   On the first line, print the minimal unlikeliness of the evolutionary tree.   Then, print $n-1$ lines, each consisting of two integers $0\\leq u,v < n$, indicating that in the most likely evolutionary tree, there is an edge between DNA string $u$ and $v$. If there are multiple answers possible, any of them will be accepted.    \n"
