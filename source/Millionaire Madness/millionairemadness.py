To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest ladder required to navigate from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a rectangular grid, where each cell represents a stack of coins with a certain height. We can approach this problem using dynamic programming.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Define the Grid**: Create a 2D list to represent the grid of coin heights.
2. **Initialize DP Table**: Use a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum ladder length needed to reach cell `(i, j)`.
3. **Base Case**: The base case is `dp[0][0] = 0`, since no ladder is needed to start at the starting point.
4. **Fill DP Table**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, calculate the minimum ladder length needed to reach it by considering the three possible moves: north, west, and east.
   - Update `dp[i][j]` with the minimum of the ladder lengths obtained from these three moves plus one (for the current cell).
5. **Result**: The answer will be stored in `dp[M-1][N-1]`.

Here's the Python code implementing the above logic:

```python
def shortest_ladder(M, N, grid):
    # Initialize the dp table with infinity
    dp = [[float('inf')] * N for _ in range(M)]
    
    # Base case: starting point
    dp[0][0] = 0
    
    # Fill the dp table
    for i in range(M):
        for j in range(N):
            if i > 0:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + 1)
            if j > 0:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + 1)
            if i < M-1:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j] + 1)
            if j < N-1:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j+1] + 1)
    
    # Return the result
    return dp[M-1][N-1]

# Read input
M, N = map(int, input().split())
grid = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
