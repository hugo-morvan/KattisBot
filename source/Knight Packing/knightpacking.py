To solve this problem, we need to determine if the first or second player will win on an \( N \times N \) chessboard under the given rules. The key observation is that the knights can only be placed on certain positions to avoid being captured by another knight.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Knight's Movement**: A knight moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that direction. This means that if a knight is placed at position \((i, j)\), the knight at positions \((i+2, j+1)\), \((i+2, j-1)\), \((i-2, j+1)\), \((i-2, j-1)\), \((i+1, j+2)\), \((i+1, j-2)\), and \((i-1, j+2)\) and \((i-1, j-2)\) must not already have a knight.

2. **Graph Representation**: We can represent the board as a graph where each cell is a node, and edges exist between nodes that are valid knight moves apart. The problem then reduces to determining if the graph is bipartite. If it is, the first player can always force a win; otherwise, the second player can always force a win.

3. **Bipartite Graph Check**: A graph is bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. For a knight's graph, this can be checked using a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from any unvisited node.

4. **Implementation**: We'll implement a BFS to check if the graph is bipartite. If it is, the first player wins; otherwise, the second player wins.

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def is_bipartite(N):
    # Create an adjacency list for the knight's graph
    adj_list = [[] for _ in range(N * N)]
    
    # Directions for knight moves
    directions = [
        (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),
        (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)
    ]
    
    # Function to get the index of a cell
