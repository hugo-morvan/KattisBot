To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected time for a smart player to complete each aphorism by following these steps:

1. **Determine the positions of the letters in the aphorism**:
   - We need to map each letter in the aphorism to its corresponding position on the circumference of the circle.

2. **Calculate the shortest path**:
   - Use a graph traversal algorithm (like Dijkstra's) to find the shortest path between consecutive letters on the circle.

3. **Compute the total time**:
   - Sum the distances between consecutive letters and convert them to time based on the player's speed.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    
    while pq:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances

def calculate_time(aphorism):
    # Define the positions of the letters on the circle
    positions = {}
    angle_per_point = 360 / 28
    angle = 0
    
    for i in range(28):
        positions[chr(i + ord('A'))] = angle
        angle += angle_per_point
    
    # Build the graph
    graph = defaultdict(dict)
    for i in range(28):
        for j in range(i + 1, 28):
            angle_diff = abs(positions[chr(i + ord('A'))] - positions[chr(j + ord('A'))])
            if angle_diff > 180:
                angle_diff = 360 - angle_diff
            graph[chr(i + ord('A'))][chr(j + ord('A'))] = angle_diff
            graph[chr(j + ord('A'))][chr(i + ord('A'))] = angle_diff
    
    # Calculate the shortest path
    distances = dijkstra(graph, 'A')
    
    # Calculate the total time
    total_time = 0
