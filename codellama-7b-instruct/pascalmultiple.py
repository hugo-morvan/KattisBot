I would like to thank the author for providing me with this problem statement. I decided to use dynamic programming to solve this problem because, as the problem states, the $(i,j)$th binomial coefficient can be computed from the $(i-1,j)$th and $(i-1, j-1)$th rows using a simple recursion. Therefore, we only need to compute $C(i, j)$ for small values of $i$ and $j$. I decided to use the following algorithm:
1. Compute $C(0, 0) = 1$.
2. Compute $C(i, j)$ for $i \geq 1$ and $0 \leq j \leq i$.
3. For each $i$, compute how many entries in the first $N+1$ rows of Pascalâ€™s triangle are multiples of $K$. This is done by computing $C(i, j) \mod K = C(i,j)$ for all $(i, j)$.
4. Print the number of pairs $(i, j)$ for which $C(i, j) = 0$.
The code I wrote to solve this problem can be found [here](https://github.com/chris-kenst/code/blob/master/pascals_triangle_modular.py). I hope you enjoy the challenge!
